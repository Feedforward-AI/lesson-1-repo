description: Create a comprehensive action plan that strengthens your case (research, evidence, proposal improvements) AND navigates the politics (key people, sequencing, objections)

# Battle Plan

Create an action plan that addresses both substance and politics.

## Usage

```
/battle-plan
```

## What This Does

Reads your project docs (especially any /clarify output) and generates a comprehensive plan covering:

**Strengthening the Case:**
- Research to conduct (competitive intel, industry precedents, frameworks)
- Proposal improvements (success metrics, ROI, risk mitigation)
- Evidence gaps to fill
- Documents to create

**Navigating the Politics:**
- People to win over and how to approach each
- Sequence of conversations
- Coalition building
- Objections to anticipate and responses

**Interleaved Execution:**
- Actions sequenced with dependencies
- Checkpoints for both substance and political progress
- Warning signs and contingencies

## Core Principle

Substance and politics are intertwined. A brilliant proposal fails without political navigation. Political skill fails without a defensible proposal. This plan addresses both.

## Best Used After

Run `/clarify` first to understand both your evidence gaps and your political landscape. Battle Plan works best with that context, but can also work standalone.

## Output

Saves an action plan to `docs/` with:
- Assessment of current state (substance + politics)
- Gap analysis
- Phased approach (Strengthen → Build Support → Execute)
- Checklists for research, documents, and conversations
- Immediate next actions
