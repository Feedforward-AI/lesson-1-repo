# Context & Key Players

## The Situation (January 2026)

**Meridian Industries**: $10B industrial distributor, ~25,000 employees. Supplies industrial, safety, and facility products across North America.

After one year and $8M spent on AI initiatives, CFO Gene Hollister and CTO Vikram Anand have sent a joint memo recommending a "90-day strategy reset" — effectively pausing AI expansion, including Jordan Torres's proposed AI Lab.

Jordan disagrees. She believes the lack of results stems from moving too slowly with inadequate tools, not from AI being overhyped.

## Key Players

| Person | Role | Stance |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Jordan Torres** | Head of AI Initiative | Protagonist. Wants AI Lab approved. Frustrated by slow pace. |
| **Gene Hollister** | CFO | Skeptical. Wants measurable ROI before more investment. "Show me a number that moves the P&L." |
| **Vikram Anand** | CTO | Cautious ally. Sees IT capacity as the bottleneck, wants training/headcount, not frontier tools. |
| **Carla Benedetti** | CEO | Initiated AI push (Davos 2025). Absent from most steering meetings. Wants results but unclear on path. |
| **Sarah Ndiaye** | VP Security | Blocker (legitimate). Concerned about data residency, audit trails, shadow AI. "I'm not the obstacle—I'm the reason we haven't had a breach." |
| **Judith Abramowitz** | CLO (Legal) | Blocker (legitimate). Concerned about IP, contracts, liability. Wants legal infrastructure before speed. |
| **Denise Caldwell** | CRO | Ally. Warns about talent attrition—3 high performers left citing "innovation culture." |
| **Pam Delgado** | CHRO | Neutral. Concerned about fairness in Lab selection, employee anxiety. |
| **Tomás Gallegos** | Associate General Counsel | Ally. Proposed alternative "guardrails not gatekeeping" legal framework. |

## Core Tensions

1. **ROI vs. Capability Building**: Gene wants numbers. Jordan says you build capacity before returns are visible.
2. **Risk Management vs. Velocity**: Sarah/Judith have real concerns; current process takes 4-6 months per initiative.
3. **Enterprise Tools vs. Frontier Tools**: EnterpriseAI.ai is approved but limited; star performers get results with "forbidden" tools.
4. **"We're Not a Tech Company"**: Gene/Vikram say be "fast followers, not pioneers." Jordan sees this as fatal delay.
