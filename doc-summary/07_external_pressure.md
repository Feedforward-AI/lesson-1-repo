## The Verdict

"Your current trajectory—37% adoption of a limited enterprise tool with shallow usage—places you in the **third quartile**. Without acceleration, the gap to leaders will become structural within 12-18 months."

## What Leaders Are Doing

**Tier 1 (Table Stakes)** — Most leaders deployed 12-18 months ago:
- AI email/document drafting (85% adoption)
- Meeting summarization (80%)
- Internal FAQ chatbots (70%)
- Product catalog search (65%)

**Meridian:** Deployed Tier 1 basics with shallow adoption.

**Tier 2 (Operational Advantage)** — Leaders actively deploying:
- AI demand forecasting (60%) — 20-30% inventory reduction
- Dynamic pricing (55%) — 2-5% margin improvement
- Predictive maintenance (50%)
- RFP response automation (45%) — 60-80% faster
- Contract review (40%) — 50% faster

**Meridian:** Zero production deployments in Tier 2.

**Tier 3 (Competitive Differentiation)** — Leaders piloting:
- Generative AI sales copilot (35%) — 25-40% productivity gain
- Customer churn prediction (30%)
- Autonomous inventory replenishment (20%)

## Meridian's Position

| Metric | Meridian | Quartile |
|--------|----------|----------|
| AI investment as % of revenue | 0.08% | Bottom |
| AI headcount | 4-6 | Bottom |
| Time from pilot to production | None completed | N/A |
| % AI projects reaching production | 0% | Bottom |

**Effective AI investment:** $2.5M (not $8M) — the rest is licenses with low utilization.

## The Shadow AI Problem

- 47% of knowledge workers use personal AI tools for work
- 78% believe personal tools outperform company tools
- 34% have shared work data with non-approved AI
- 67% say AI tool access influences employer choice

**Talent implication:** Distributors with restrictive AI policies report 2.3x higher turnover among top performers.

## GCP Recommendation

**Option 3: Targeted Lab** offers best risk-adjusted path forward.
- Legitimizes shadow AI
- Creates governed environment for learning
- Produces evidence for broader investment
- Retains high performers

**Warning:** "The 90-Day Pause is particularly risky. In our experience, 'strategic resets' in fast-moving technology areas become permanent slowdowns."
