# The Provocation: Gene/Vikram Joint Memo

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**From:** Gene Hollister (CFO) + Vikram Anand (CTO)
**To:** Carla Benedetti (CEO)

---

## The Verdict

"We've spent $8M and have little to show for it in terms of measurable business impact. That's a hard sentence to write, but it's honest."

---

## What They Spent ($8M total)

- EnterpriseAI.ai licenses (25,000 seats): $5.4M
- Consulting: $800K
- Training: $500K
- Infrastructure: $700K
- Jordan's team: $600K

---

## What They Got

- **37% monthly active users** — above industry benchmarks
- **But usage is shallow**: email drafting, meeting summaries
- High-value use cases: <2% of usage
- Pilots: 1 completed (mixed), 1 ongoing, 2 delayed/cancelled
- **No measurable impact** on revenue, cost structure, or cycle times

## Their Diagnosis (They Disagree)

**Gene**: We moved too fast on adoption, too slow on discipline. Prove ROI before expanding.

**Vikram**: We moved too slow because we lacked systematic governance. Need IT capacity (3 FTEs, $420K) and formal training ($180K certification program).

---

## Their Recommendation: 90-Day Strategy Reset

1. **Pause** new AI investments
2. **Audit** current tools and pilots
3. **Define** 3-5 measurable use cases for 2026
4. **Evaluate** the Lab proposal against revised criteria
5. **Decide** on investment by end of Q1

Plus: Add 3 IT FTEs ($420K) and run certification program ($180K).

## Key Quotes

"We're not a technology company. Meridian's competitive advantage is operational excellence, customer relationships, and domain expertise—not technical innovation. We should be fast followers, not pioneers."

"The MIT Sloan study on enterprise AI adoption (2025) is instructive here: only about 5% of AI projects deliver measurable business impact. The other 95% fail to scale, fail to produce ROI, or get abandoned. Being a pioneer means absorbing that 95% failure rate ourselves. Being a fast follower means letting others pay that tuition, then learning from the 5% that actually work."

## Jordan's Problem

The memo says her Lab proposal "isn't ready" because it doesn't answer: What will the Lab produce? How will we measure success? What's the exit criteria?

She has until Q1 end to make her case—or the pause becomes permanent.
