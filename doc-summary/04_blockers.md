# The Blockers: Security, Legal, Finance

## Sarah Ndiaye (VP Security) — April 2025

**Core concerns:**
- Data residency: Frontier tools route data outside approved data centers (GDPR, government contracts)
- Audit trails: Proposed tools don't integrate with SIEM; can't track data or respond to incidents
- Training data liability: Getty v. Stability AI, NYT v. OpenAI — unclear IP exposure
- Shadow AI: Employees already using personal ChatGPT despite policy

**Her position:** "I'm not saying no. I'm saying we need 4-6 weeks for comprehensive risk assessment."

**Reality:** The 4-6 weeks became 4-6 months, then ongoing.

**Her defense:** "I'm not the obstacle. I'm the reason we haven't had a breach."

## Judith Abramowitz (CLO) — May 2025

**Core concerns:**
- IP ownership: AI-generated content may not be copyrightable; unclear who owns what
- Trade secret exposure: Data entered into AI may lose legal protection
- Contractual liability: AI-generated proposals could bind Meridian to unintended terms
- Employment law: AI in HR functions inherits model biases; EEOC liability
- Vendor agreements: Broad usage rights, limited liability caps, unilateral modification rights

**Her recommendation:** "Pause expansion until vendor agreements are renegotiated."

**Her position:** "I'm not opposed to AI adoption. I'm asking that we do it with appropriate legal infrastructure in place."

## Gene Hollister (CFO) — Ongoing

**Core concerns:**
- $8M spent, no measurable P&L impact
- Lab proposal asks for more money before proving current value
- Hidden costs in Lab budget (opportunity cost of star performers not accounted)
- No specific metrics, just "questions we should be able to answer"
- No kill criteria — how would we know to stop?

**His position:** "I don't fund activities. I fund outcomes."

**What he needs:**
- "After 12 months, we will have delivered [X specific result] that produces [Y measurable business impact]"
- Three concrete examples with numbers
- Clear milestones for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4

## The Pattern

Every initiative enters a sequential review: Security → Legal → Procurement → Pilot approval. Each step adds 4-6 weeks. Cumulative effect: 4-6 months minimum.

By the time something is approved, the technology has moved on.

Tomás Gallegos (Associate GC) proposed alternative: "Default yes with guardrails" — blanket approval for low-risk use cases, rapid review for edge cases. But Judith hasn't adopted it.
