# Grassroots Success Stories

All built with personal AI subscriptions. All technically violating policy. All creating real value.

## Darius Thompson (Receiving Clerk, 5 months tenure)

**Innovation:** "Hot Sheet" — AI matches advance ship notices against pending orders to identify priority inventory before trucks arrive.

**Impact:** Time-to-available for priority items: 8 hours → 2 hours. Zero late shipments from receiving delays. Back-of-envelope: $300-400K annually company-wide.

**Friction:** IT wants him to stop pending security review. Can't connect to WMS. Can't scale to other facilities.

## Kenji Okonkwo (Brand Coordinator, 14 months tenure)

**Innovation:** Synthetic focus groups — AI role-plays customer personas to test messaging before expensive real research.

**Impact:** Ran 50 synthetic interviews in 6 hours (vs. $42K and 6 weeks for traditional). Caught positioning mistake that real focus group later validated. Reliability message tested 40% stronger than planned cost-savings message.

**Friction:** CMO worried about "fake data." Legal wants methodology review. Research agency protecting turf.

## Aaliyah Jackson (Account Executive, 2.5 years tenure)

**Innovation:** Pre-call intelligence briefs — AI synthesizes CRM, orders, support tickets, competitive intel into one-page prep docs.

**Impact:** Call prep: 45 min → 5 min. Q3: 127% of quota (team average: 94%). Caught cross-account pattern that prevented customer satisfaction crisis.

**Friction:** CRM team's "official solution" is 18 months out. IT won't give API access. Copy-pasting data manually.

## Elena Vasquez (Product Manager, 3 years tenure)

**Innovation:** Cross-channel customer synthesis — piped CS calls, IT tickets, sales notes, survey data into AI to find patterns no single team could see.

**Impact:** Found 3 hidden problems: packaging issue ($180K savings), silent integration bug ($200K/yr), unspoken feature demand (landed $2.1M deal).

**Friction:** Each department protective of "their" data. No sanctioned process. "Different department's problem."

## Maria Elena Gutierrez (Production Coordinator, 18 years tenure)

**Innovation:** Operational knowledge capture — used ChatGPT to organize 20 years of warehouse knowledge into supervisor checklists.

**Impact:** Shrinkage down 12%. Damage claims from Zone C down 40%. Investigation time down 30%.
