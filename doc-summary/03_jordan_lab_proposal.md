# Jordan's AI Lab Proposal

**Date:** September 2025
**From:** Jordan Torres, Head of AI Initiative

---

## The Ask

- **$400K** net new annual investment
- **10 people**: 8 "star performers" (50-60% time) + 2 AI developers
- **12-month** initial commitment with quarterly reviews
- **Access to frontier tools**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- **Governance**: Security and Legal get "visibility, not veto power"

---

## The Problem She's Solving

"We're stuck."

- 12% adoption of EnterpriseAI.ai (note: later reports show 37%, but shallow usage)
- Minimal workflow transformation
- Growing frustration from best people
- Zero competitive advantage
- Technology advancing faster than our evaluation process

"We've created a system optimized for risk avoidance that's actually generating a different kind of risk: the risk of falling behind."

## How It Would Work

**The Lab produces quarterly:**
1. Use case library (what works)
2. Failure analysis (what doesn't)
3. Deployment recommendations
4. Capability assessment
5. Training materials

**Star performers stay 50% in regular roles** — keeps them grounded, builds evangelists.

## Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Star performer backfill | $180K |
| 2 developers | $280K |
| Tools/APIs | $120K |
| Infrastructure | $40K |
| Training | $30K |
| **Total** | **$650K** |
| Less reallocation | ($250K) |
| **Net new** | **$400K** |

Note: Could save $540K by cutting EnterpriseAI.ai licenses from 2,000 to 500.

## Gene's Concerns (from his annotated version)

1. **No defined success metrics** — "These are questions, not metrics"
2. **Hidden costs** — Real cost is $800K+ when you count opportunity cost of star performers
3. **No kill criteria** — What would cause us to stop?
4. **"Visibility not veto" for Security/Legal** — Creates accountability gaps
5. **12 months too long** — Wants 6-month go/no-go decision

**His bottom line:** "I'm not saying no. I'm saying I can't say yes to *this*."

## What Gene Needs to Approve

1. Specific, measurable outcomes for each quarter
2. Clear kill criteria
3. Realistic cost accounting
4. Evidence competitors are actually ahead
5. Governance model Sarah and Judith can live with
