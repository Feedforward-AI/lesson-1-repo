# Potential Allies

## Denise Caldwell (CRO) — October 2025

**The talent warning:**
- 3 top performers left citing "I want to work somewhere serious about AI"
- Marcus Chen (6 yrs): "I spent six months waiting for approval. At [new company], I had access day one."
- Priya Sharma (4 yrs): "I was losing deals because their team could turn around analyses overnight."
- David Okonkwo (3 yrs): "Every idea needs twelve approvals."

**Key quote:** "The slow pace isn't just frustrating our internal champions—it's becoming a talent and competitive liability."

**Her frame:** "Innovation theater" — we announce AI initiatives but nothing changes in day-to-day work.

## Tomás Gallegos (Associate GC) — July 2025

**Alternative legal framework:**
- Current process: Sequential sign-offs = 4-6 month approval cycles
- His proposal: "Default yes with guardrails"
  - Blanket approval for low-risk use cases (internal docs, research, drafting)
  - Clear prohibited uses (no PII, no contracts, no customer-facing without review)
  - Required 2-hour training
  - 48-hour rapid review for edge cases (not 6 weeks)

**On the Lab:** "The Lab is actually lower risk than broad deployment — smaller attack surface, more sophisticated users, better monitoring, clear accountability."

**Key insight:** "We're not minimizing risk—we're shifting it. Shadow AI, talent attrition, competitive lag, opportunity cost."

**Status:** Judith hasn't adopted his framework.

## Carla Benedetti (CEO)

**Original vision (January 2025, post-Davos):** "This isn't an IT initiative. This is about how every function, every team, every individual at Meridian thinks about their work. The only failure mode I'm worried about is standing still."

**Current stance:** Absent from most Steering Committee meetings. Wants results but needs a "clearer story about what we're building toward."

**Her requirement:** "Before I approve significant new investment, I need to understand: What did we learn? What would we do differently? How will we measure success?"

**Opportunity:** If Jordan can answer Carla's questions, she may overrule Gene/Vikram.

## Vikram Anand (CTO) — Partial Ally

Signed the pause memo but his diagnosis differs from Gene's. He thinks the problem is IT capacity, not AI ambition. Wants:
- 3 new IT FTEs for AI operations ($420K)
- Certification program for existing staff ($180K)

**His view:** "Our security review delays aren't because my team is obstructionist—they're because we're being asked to evaluate tools we weren't trained to evaluate."

**Opportunity:** If Jordan can show the Lab addresses his capacity concerns, he might shift.
