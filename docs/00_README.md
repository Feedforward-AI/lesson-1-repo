# Meridian Industries - AI Initiative Documents

## Context

You are reviewing internal documents from Meridian Industries, a $10B industrial and commercial distributor (~25,000 employees) that has been attempting an AI transformation over the past year. Meridian supplies industrial, safety, and facility products to manufacturers, commercial buildings, and institutions across North America.

**The situation (January 2026):**

Jordan Torres, Head of AI Initiative, has just received a joint memo from the CFO (Gene Hollister) and CTO (Vikram Anand) that effectively calls for hitting pause on AI expansion. After a year of effort and $8M in spending, they see little measurable return and recommend a "90-day strategy reset" before any new investments—including Jordan's proposed AI Lab.

Jordan disagrees. She believes the lack of results stems from moving too slowly with inadequate tools, not from AI being overhyped. She needs to respond.

**Your task:**

Using these documents (and the Feed Forward materials you have access to), help Jordan craft a response to the Gene/Vikram memo—one that doesn't just defend the past year, but makes a compelling case for the AI Lab as the path forward.

## Key Tensions to Navigate

1. **ROI vs. Capability Building**: Gene wants measurable returns. Jordan believes you have to build capacity before returns are visible.

2. **Risk Management vs. Velocity**: Sarah and Judith have legitimate concerns. But the current process is so slow that nothing gets done.

3. **Enterprise Tools vs. Frontier Tools**: EnterpriseAI.ai is approved but limited. The star performers are getting results with better tools they're not supposed to use.

4. **The Lab as Investment or Expense**: Gene sees it as more spending before proving value. Jordan sees it as the mechanism to finally generate value.

5. **"We're Not a Tech Company"**: The Gene/Vikram memo explicitly says Meridian should be a "fast follower, not a pioneer." Jordan believes this frame misunderstands what's at stake.

## Questions to Consider

As you work on Jordan's response:

- What does the Feed Forward research say about ROI timing for AI investments?
- How would you characterize Meridian's current "level" of AI development?
- What's the difference between component change and architectural change? Which is the Lab about?
- How do you address legitimate security and legal concerns without letting them become permanent blockers?
- What's the cost of waiting vs. the cost of moving forward?
- How do the star performer examples strengthen the case for the Lab?

## A Note on the Documents

These documents reflect a messy reality. People disagree. Timelines slip. Good ideas get stuck in process. Employees work around official systems. Leadership wants results but also wants safety.

There are no villains here—just people with different perspectives trying to figure out something genuinely hard.

Jordan's job is not to attack Gene or Vikram. It's to help everyone see the situation differently.

Good luck.
