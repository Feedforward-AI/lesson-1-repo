**Subject:** AI at Meridian - A Year in Review and Path Forward

Carla,

As we discussed in December, we\'ve prepared a joint assessment of
Meridian\'s AI initiatives after one full year. We approached this
collaboratively because we believe the path forward requires alignment
between technology vision and financial discipline.

What We Set Out to Do

In January 2025, you challenged us to embrace AI as \"an organizational
transformation, not a technology project.\" We took that seriously. We
deployed EnterpriseAI.ai across the enterprise, stood up a steering
committee, launched pilot programs, invested in training, and began
building toward more ambitious capabilities.

What We Spent

**Total 2025 AI investment: \$1.9M**

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  **Category**                          **Amount**

  EnterpriseAI.ai licenses              \$720K

  Consulting and advisory               \$340K

  Training and enablement               \$180K

  Infrastructure and integration        \$290K

  Personnel (AI Initiative team)        \$370K
  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

*This excludes indirect costs (time spent in steering committee
meetings, security reviews, etc.) which we estimate at \$200-300K in
opportunity cost.*

What We Got

**We want to be honest: the measurable returns are modest.**

**[EnterpriseAI.ai Adoption]{.underline}**

• 2,000 licenses deployed

• 12% monthly active users (240 employees)

• Majority of usage: email drafting and meeting summaries

• High-value use cases (data analysis, workflow automation): minimal
adoption

**[Pilot Programs]{.underline}**

• 4 pilots proposed, 1 completed, 1 ongoing, 2 delayed/cancelled

• Customer insights pilot: team reports 20% faster analysis cycle
(unverified)

• Marketing pilot: inconclusive results

• Supply chain pilot: delayed to 2026

• R&D pilot: never launched

**[Productivity Impact]{.underline}**

• No measurable impact on revenue, cost structure, or cycle times

• Anecdotal reports of individual productivity gains

• No workflow transformations completed

Our Assessment

**We\'ve spent nearly \$2M and have little to show for it.** That\'s a
hard sentence to write, but it\'s honest.

However, we don\'t agree on why.

**Gene\'s view:** We moved too fast on adoption and too slow on
discipline. We bought enterprise licenses before we had use cases. We
launched pilots without success criteria. We asked for more investment
(the Lab proposal) before demonstrating value from current investment.
The right path forward is consolidation: reduce spend, focus on
high-value use cases, prove ROI before expanding.

**Vikram\'s view:** We moved too slow, period. Every initiative got
bogged down in reviews, approvals, and process. By the time we approved
a pilot, the moment had passed. EnterpriseAI.ai was a compromise
tool---enterprise-safe but capability-limited. We never gave people
tools good enough to transform their work. The lesson isn\'t to
retrench; it\'s to move faster with better tools.

Where We Agree

Despite our different diagnoses, we agree on several things:

**1. The status quo isn\'t working.** Continuing current trajectory will
produce similar results: spend without impact.

**2. We need clearer success metrics.** \"AI transformation\" is too
vague. We need specific, measurable objectives.

**3. The Lab proposal, as written, isn\'t ready.** Jordan\'s proposal
has merit, but it doesn\'t answer basic questions: What will the Lab
produce? How will we measure success? What\'s the exit criteria?

**4. We\'re not a technology company.** Meridian\'s competitive
advantage is operational excellence, customer relationships, and domain
expertise---not technical innovation. We should be fast followers, not
pioneers. The risk of moving too slow is real; the risk of moving too
fast into unproven territory is also real.

Recommendation

**We propose a 90-day strategy reset:**

**1. Pause** new AI investments pending clearer strategic framework

**2. Audit** current tools and pilots for actual usage and value

**3. Define** 3-5 specific, measurable use cases for 2026

**4. Evaluate** the Lab proposal against revised success criteria

**5. Decide** on 2026 investment level by end of Q1

We recognize this may be perceived as \"slowing down\" at a moment when
others are speeding up. But disciplined investment beats undisciplined
experimentation. Meridian didn\'t become an industry leader by chasing
every trend. We became a leader by making smart bets at the right time.

We\'re ready to discuss at your convenience.
