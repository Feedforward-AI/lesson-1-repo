# EnterpriseAI.ai Usage Analytics Report
**Period:** March - December 2025  
**Prepared by:** IT Analytics Team  
**Date:** January 2, 2026

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes usage patterns for EnterpriseAI.ai, Meridian's enterprise AI platform, since its deployment in March 2025.

**Key findings:**
- Monthly active users have stabilized at ~40% of licensed employees—above industry benchmarks
- However, usage is concentrated in low-value activities (email drafting, meeting summaries)
- High-value features (data analysis, workflow automation) show minimal adoption (<2%)
- Advanced capabilities (coding, agent creation, complex analysis) represent <0.5% of usage
- Despite respectable adoption metrics, no measurable productivity or financial impact

**The paradox:** We succeeded at adoption but failed at transformation.

## Usage Trends

### Monthly Active Users (MAU)

| Month | MAU | % of Licenses |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| March | 14,750 | 59% |
| April | 12,500 | 50% |
| May | 11,250 | 45% |
| June | 10,500 | 42% |
| July | 9,750 | 39% |
| August | 9,500 | 38% |
| September | 9,250 | 37% |
| October | 9,200 | 37% |
| November | 9,100 | 36% |
| December | 9,236 | 37% |

**Note:** MAU defined as users with at least one interaction during the calendar month.

### Usage Pattern

Initial adoption exceeded expectations, with nearly 60% trial rate in the first month. Adoption declined through Q2 before stabilizing around 37% by mid-year. This is actually above industry benchmarks (typical enterprise AI tools see 20-30% sustained MAU). 

**The problem isn't that people stopped using it. It's what they're using it for.**

## Feature Utilization

### By Feature Category (December 2025)

| Feature | Monthly Uses | % of Total |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Email drafting/editing | 127,840 | 45% |
| Meeting summarization | 56,820 | 20% |
| Document summarization | 42,615 | 15% |
| Presentation assistance | 28,410 | 10% |
| Status reports/updates | 17,046 | 6% |
| Process documentation | 8,523 | 3% |
| Spreadsheet analysis | 2,841 | 1% |
| Other/Advanced | 568 | <0.5% |
| **Total** | **284,663** | **100%** |

### Analysis

Usage is overwhelmingly concentrated in text generation tasks: emails, summaries, and document polish. These represent 90% of all usage. While these have convenience value, they represent minimal transformation potential.

**Critical gap:** High-value features—data analysis, workflow automation, coding, complex problem-solving—represent less than 2% of total usage. These are the capabilities that drive measurable business impact. They're also the capabilities that EnterpriseAI.ai struggles to deliver well.

## User Behavior Segmentation

### User Types (based on December activity)

| Segment | Users | % of Total | Avg. Uses/Month |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Power users** (50+ uses) | 462 | 2% | 94 |
| **Regular users** (20-49 uses) | 1,847 | 7% | 31 |
| **Moderate users** (10-19 uses) | 2,771 | 11% | 14 |
| **Light users** (1-9 uses) | 4,156 | 17% | 4 |
| **Dormant** (0 uses, but used previously) | 8,750 | 35% | 0 |
| **Never used** | 7,014 | 28% | 0 |

### Use Case Depth Analysis

| Use Case Category | % of Active Users Engaging | % of Total Usage |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Basic text generation (email, summaries) | 98% | 90% |
| Document creation (reports, presentations) | 45% | 8% |
| Data analysis (spreadsheet queries) | 4% | 1.5% |
| Workflow automation | 1% | 0.3% |
| Coding/tool building | 0.3% | <0.2% |

### Analysis

Even among active users, the vast majority (98%) use the tool only for basic text generation. The advanced capabilities that could drive transformation are essentially unused. Only ~28 employees across the entire company have used coding or automation features.

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual license cost | $5,400,000 |
| Total AI investment | $8,000,000 |
| Active monthly users | 9,236 |
| Cost per active user/month | $72 |
| Average uses per active user | 31/month |
| Cost per use | $2.33 |

### Value Assessment

At current utilization, we have achieved respectable adoption (37% MAU, above industry benchmarks of 20-30%). However, usage is concentrated in low-value activities.

**Estimated time savings from current usage:**
- Email drafting: ~5 min saved per use × 127,840 uses = 10,653 hours/month
- Meeting summaries: ~8 min saved per use × 56,820 uses = 7,576 hours/month
- Other text tasks: ~5 min average × 100,003 uses = 8,334 hours/month
- **Total: ~26,500 hours/month = ~318,000 hours/year**

At average fully-loaded cost of $50/hour, this represents ~$15.9M in theoretical productivity value.

**However:** No workflow has been eliminated or restructured. No headcount has been reduced. No cycle times have improved. The "saved" time is absorbed back into the workday without measurable business impact.

**The question isn't whether people use the tool. It's whether the tool changes outcomes.**

## The Missing Use Cases

Based on analysis of user feedback and industry benchmarks, the following high-value capabilities remain essentially unused:

| Capability | Current Usage | Potential Value | Barrier |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Data analysis across sources | <2% | High | Tool limitations, security restrictions |
| Competitive intelligence synthesis | <1% | High | Content blocks, data access |
| Process automation | <1% | Very High | Tool limitations, IT involvement required |
| Customer insight generation | <1% | High | Data access restrictions |
| Coding/tool building | <0.5% | Very High | Tool limitations, skill gap |
| Document analysis at scale | <2% | Medium-High | Performance issues with large docs |

These are precisely the capabilities that would drive measurable ROI. They are also precisely the capabilities where EnterpriseAI.ai underperforms compared to frontier tools.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Reframe success metrics:** Adoption rate is a vanity metric. Focus on workflow transformation and measurable outcomes.

2. **Investigate high-value use cases:** Why is data analysis usage below 2%? Is it tool limitations, training gaps, or access restrictions?

3. **Evaluate tool-market fit:** Current usage patterns suggest employees have found a ceiling on what this tool can do for them. Consider whether alternative approaches might unlock higher-value use cases.

4. **Identify power users:** The 462 power users (2% of workforce) may be finding value others aren't. Understand what they're doing differently.

5. **Address the content restriction issue:** 19% of complaints cite content limitations. These may be blocking legitimate business use cases.

## Appendix: Industry Benchmark Comparison

| Metric | Meridian | Industry Avg | Assessment |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| MAU (% of licensed) | 37% | 20-30% | Above average |
| Power users (50+ uses) | 2% | 3-5% | Below average |
| High-value feature usage | <2% | 10-15% | Significantly below |
| Measurable ROI documented | 0% | 15-25% | Critical gap |

We are above average on adoption but below average on impact. This is the core challenge.
