# EMAIL THREAD

Vikram,

I've been going through the numbers ahead of the budget cycle, and I want to flag something.

We're at $5.8M in AI-related spending for the year, with a run rate that suggests $8M by December. This includes:

- EnterpriseAI.ai licenses (25,000 seats): $4.05M (annualized $5.4M)
- External consulting (McKinsey AI readiness): $600K
- Training programs: $375K
- Infrastructure and integration: $525K
- Jordan's team (allocated portion): $450K

I've asked my team to document measurable productivity gains or cost savings attributable to these investments. So far, we have:

- Customer insights team reports "faster" analysis (no quantified time savings)
- Marketing produced 30% more first drafts (unclear if this translated to output)
- Executive summaries for board materials "significantly improved" (per Carla)

I'm not seeing anything that would justify $8M if I had to defend it to the board. And with the Lab proposal asking for another $400K+, I need to understand the thesis here.

Can we find 30 minutes next week?

Gene,

Happy to discuss. A few thoughts before we meet:

1. I share your desire for measurable outcomes. That said, I'd push back gently on the framing. We're eight months into building foundational capabilities. Expecting P&L impact this quickly may not be the right benchmark.

2. The comparison I'd offer: when we implemented Salesforce in 2019, we were $6M in before we saw measurable sales productivity gains. Some investments compound over time rather than paying out immediately.

3. The usage numbers are actually above industry benchmarks—we're at 42% MAU on EnterpriseAI.ai, which is better than most enterprise AI deployments. But I'd argue that's masking the real problem. People are using it for email drafts and meeting summaries, not for anything transformative. We haven't given people compelling reasons to change their workflows.

4. On the Lab: I understand the optics of "asking for more before proving current value." But Jordan's argument is that we're not seeing value *because* we're moving too slowly with too-limited tools. The Lab is meant to break that pattern.

Let's discuss. Thursday at 2?

Thursday works.

To your Salesforce comparison: fair point, but Salesforce had a clear use case and we could model the ROI before committing. Here, I'm not even sure what the use case is. "AI will transform everything" isn't a business case.

And if high adoption just means everyone's drafting slightly faster emails, shouldn't we prove we can get real value before expanding?

See you Thursday.

Gene, Vikram—

I'm glad you're having this conversation. A few thoughts from my end:

Gene, your questions are exactly right. We should be able to articulate what we're getting for $8M. "It feels valuable" isn't good enough.

Vikram, I hear the "it takes time" argument, but we need more than patience. We need a clearer story about what we're building toward and how we'll know when we're there.

I'm less focused on this year's spend than on what we're proposing for next year. Before I approve significant new investment (including the Lab), I need to understand:

1. What did we learn in 2025?
2. What would we do differently with more resources?
3. How will we measure success in 2026?

Jordan's been frustrated, and I get it. But frustration isn't a strategy. Let's come out of your Thursday meeting with a framework I can take to the board.

Carla
