# STAR PERFORMER PROJECT SUMMARIES (final)

---

## Becky Stoltzfus
**Role:** HR Business Partner, Talent Development  
**Years at Meridian:** 6  
**Project:** Career Conversation Coach

### What She Built

Meridian runs an annual career development process: every employee has a conversation with their manager about growth, goals, and opportunities. In theory. In practice, most managers find these conversations awkward and unproductive. They default to generic advice or just review past performance.

Becky built a coaching prep tool:
1. Manager inputs employee's role, tenure, recent projects, and stated interests
2. Claude generates customized conversation starters, development suggestions, and questions to explore
3. Manager reviews and adapts, then enters the conversation with a real plan

### Results
- Piloted with 25 managers in Q3 2025
- Employee satisfaction with career conversations up 35% in pilot group (vs. 2% org-wide)
- Manager confidence in having these conversations up significantly (qualitative feedback)
- Three internal promotions in pilot group attributed partially to better career visibility

### Her Take
"I built this because I care about people's careers. Our managers want to do right by their teams but don't have the skills or time to prepare thoughtful conversations. AI helped me help them. But I'm terrified someone's going to tell me I violated data privacy, even though I'm careful about what I input."

### Risk Note
Career conversations touch on sensitive information: performance assessments, salary expectations, personal goals. Becky says she anonymizes inputs, but there's no governance around this. If the Lab existed, this use case could be built properly with appropriate safeguards.

### Pam Delgado Note
"Becky's pilot is the first thing that's actually moved the needle on manager effectiveness in years. If we shut this down for policy reasons, I need to understand what we're protecting against, because right now we're protecting against success."

## Tony Scarpelli
**Role:** Regional Sales Director, Northeast  
**Years at Meridian:** 14  
**Project:** Deal Intelligence System

### What He Built

Tony's region includes Meridian's largest accounts and most complex deals. These deals have long histories—years of proposals, negotiations, relationship dynamics. Knowing the history matters, but it's scattered across CRM notes, old emails, and people's memories.

Tony built a deal intelligence system:
1. Aggregated all historical touchpoints for major accounts into structured documents
2. Created "account memory" files that capture relationship context, past objections, decision-maker preferences
3. Uses Claude to brief himself before major meetings: "What do I need to know about this account?"
4. Generates customized prep documents for each significant customer interaction

### Results
- Closed two deals in Q3 that had been stalled for 18+ months (attributed to better understanding of historical context)
- New reps onboarding to major accounts now use Tony's system to get up to speed
- Win rate on complex deals up 15% in his region vs. comparable regions

### His Take
"I'm old school. Relationships matter. But my memory isn't what it used to be, and the CRM is useless for anything nuanced. AI gives me my memory back. I remember things I'd forgotten. I see patterns I missed. I walk into meetings more prepared than I've ever been."

### Sales Leadership Note
"Tony's approach should be standard for every major account manager. The fact that he built this on his own, with his own tools, is both impressive and embarrassing for us as an organization." — Denise Caldwell, CRO

| Maria Elena Gutierrez | Operations | 12% shrinkage reduction |
| Wendy Schafer | Marketing | 6-week competitive intel lead time |
| Carl Henriksen | Supply Chain | $180K shipping delays avoided |

None of these results came from EnterpriseAI.ai.  
All of them came from people working around the official system.  
All of them involved some degree of policy violation.  
All of them created value we should be capturing, not suppressing.

The AI Lab isn't about giving special people special toys. It's about legitimizing what's already happening, governing it properly, and spreading the learning across the organization.
