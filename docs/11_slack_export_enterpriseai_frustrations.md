## #general-chat

**March 5, 2025**

**@tchen:** Just got access to EnterpriseAI.ai. Anyone else tried it yet?

**@psharma:** Playing with it now. The email stuff is actually pretty good.

**@tchen:** Yeah, emails work. Tried to get it to analyze a spreadsheet and it gave me a recipe for banana bread. Not kidding.

**@mlopez:** 😂 did you try the meeting summaries?

**@tchen:** Not yet, got a meeting at 2, will report back

---

**March 6, 2025**

**@tchen:** Ok meeting summary verdict: it captured like 60% of what actually mattered and added a bunch of stuff nobody said

**@psharma:** Same experience. It turned a joke I made into an "action item"

**@jthompson:** Wait so now there's an official record of me needing to "investigate pizza options for team morale"?

**@psharma:** I deleted it but yeah, that was in there

**@mlopez:** This is going to be a problem lol

**April 22, 2025**

**@kwilson:** Is EnterpriseAI.ai down for anyone else?

**@tchen:** Working for me

**@kwilson:** Hmm. Keeps giving me "I can't help with that" when I ask it to summarize a competitor analysis

**@rbrown:** Might be hitting the content filter. I got blocked trying to analyze some market research that mentioned a competitor's legal issues

**@kwilson:** Great so I can't use it for actual work

**@rbrown:** Basically

---

**June 14, 2025**

**@dokonkwo:** Genuine question: is anyone actually using EnterpriseAI.ai regularly?

**@tchen:** For emails, yeah

**@mlopez:** I stopped after it hallucinated a customer name in a summary

**@jthompson:** I used it once and my manager asked why my email "sounded weird"

**@kwilson:** The real answer is everyone's using personal ChatGPT accounts and just not talking about it

**@rbrown:** ☝️

**@dokonkwo:** But that's against policy?

**@kwilson:** 🤷

---

**August 3, 2025**

**@tchen:** New EnterpriseAI.ai update rolled out. Anyone notice improvements?

**@psharma:** Honestly can't tell the difference

**@mlopez:** It's faster I think?

**@tchen:** Still can't do anything useful with data though

**@rbrown:** I asked it to help me build a simple dashboard and it gave me instructions on how to build a dashboard instead of actually building it

**@kwilson:** EVERY TIME. "Here's how you could do this:" - no I want YOU to do it

**@rbrown:** Exactly

**October 10, 2025**

**@newguy_mike:** Hey everyone, just started last week. Question about the AI tools - is EnterpriseAI.ai good? My last company we used Claude directly

**@tchen:** Welcome! And... it's fine for basic stuff

**@psharma:** It's what we've got

**@kwilson:** You'll miss Claude

**@rbrown:** 👆

**@mlopez:** Don't let anyone hear you say that

**@newguy_mike:** 😬

## #marketing

**April 3, 2025**

**@wschafer:** Team - I'd encourage everyone to try EnterpriseAI.ai for first drafts. I've been using it for email campaigns and it's surprisingly helpful.

**@dyoo:** I'll give it a shot. What prompts are you using?

**@wschafer:** I'll share my template doc. Key is being really specific about audience and tone.

---

**May 15, 2025**

**@dyoo:** @wschafer following up on the EnterpriseAI thing. I tried it for the product launch copy and... I spent more time fixing it than if I'd just written it myself

**@wschafer:** What happened?

**@dyoo:** It kept inserting claims we can't substantiate. Had to check every sentence against legal guidelines.

**@wschafer:** Yeah fair. It's better for internal stuff than external comms

**@lvega:** I just don't trust it. Rather write my own.

---

**September 8, 2025**

**@wschafer:** Hot take: we've been using EnterpriseAI.ai for 6 months and I don't think it's made us faster. We just do the same work with an extra review step now.

**@dyoo:** I've actually stopped using it

**@lvega:** Same

**@wschafer:** I'm going to bring this up to Jordan. We're supposed to be transforming work but this is just... overhead

**@mobi:** The problem is the tool, not the concept. I've seen what other systems can do. This one is like using a 2022 model.

**@wschafer:** What do you mean?

**@mobi:** EnterpriseAI is built on an older foundation. The cutting edge stuff is way better. But we can't use it.

## #product-dev

**July 22, 2025**

**@rcartwright:** Frustrated. Just tried to use EnterpriseAI to help spec out a new feature and it clearly doesn't understand our product at all.

**@ykim:** Did you give it context?

**@rcartwright:** 3 paragraphs of context. It still gave me generic SaaS advice that doesn't apply to us.

**@jlin:** The enterprise tools are trained to be generic. That's by design. They don't know Meridian.

**@rcartwright:** So what's the point?

**@jlin:** Good question

---

**November 12, 2025**

**@jlin:** Just FYI - I've been experimenting with some other tools on my own time for a personal project. The difference in capability is... significant.

**@rcartwright:** What tools?

**@jlin:** Claude mostly. It can actually code.

**@ykim:** We're not supposed to use that for work

**@jlin:** I know. I'm just saying. There's a reason people are frustrated.

**@rcartwright:** Does Jordan know how big the gap is?

**@jlin:** Oh she knows. She's been trying to get us better tools for months.

## #random

**October 28, 2025**

**@tchen:** Caption contest: EnterpriseAI.ai just generated this summary of our all-hands: "The CEO discussed weather conditions and their impact on employee morale."

**@mlopez:** She mentioned it was raining in passing! For like 2 seconds!

**@kwilson:** But did she discuss the IMPACT ON MORALE

**@tchen:** Apparently so

**@rbrown:** AI summary of my last 1:1 said I was "concerned about work-life balance" because I mentioned I went on vacation

**@psharma:** Mine said I "expressed reservations about the product roadmap" because I asked a clarifying question

**@mlopez:** This is why I stopped letting it summarize

**@tchen:** But managers keep asking for the summaries because they think they're useful 🙃

---

**December 1, 2025**

**@kwilson:** Honest poll: When's the last time you used EnterpriseAI.ai?

**@tchen:** This morning for an email

**@psharma:** Last week I think

**@mlopez:** Two weeks? Maybe three?

**@rbrown:** I genuinely don't remember

**@newguy_mike:** Never. After what everyone told me I didn't bother.

**@kwilson:** Cool cool cool. We're paying like $5 million for this.

**@tchen:** Are we really?

**@kwilson:** Something like that. I saw a number somewhere.

**@mlopez:** 😬
