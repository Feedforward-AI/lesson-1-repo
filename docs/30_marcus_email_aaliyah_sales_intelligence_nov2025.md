**Subject:** One of my reps built something I wish we all had

Jordan,

Maria Elena told me you're collecting stories about people using AI in creative ways. I've got one.

Aaliyah Jackson, Senior Account Executive on my Southwest team. 29 years old, been with us about two and a half years, came over from Grainger. Consistently one of my top performers—but what she just showed me explains a lot about why.

---

Here's the problem she was solving:

Before a customer call or visit, a good rep needs to know:
- Recent order history (what they're buying, trends up or down)
- Open support tickets (are they frustrated about something?)
- CRM notes (what did the last rep discuss? any commitments made?)
- Competitive intel (are they also buying from Fastenal? did we lose a bid recently?)
- Contract status (when's renewal? any special pricing?)

That information exists. But it's in five different systems. CRM. ERP. Support ticketing. The competitive intel spreadsheet that Kevin maintains. The contract database.

Aaliyah was spending 30-45 minutes before each significant customer interaction pulling this together manually. Copy, paste, read, synthesize, repeat. For every call.

So she built what she calls a "pre-call brief."

---

What she did:

She can't connect directly to our systems (IT won't give her API access, which I understand), so her process is manual but clever:

1. She pulls the relevant screens from each system—screenshots and copy-paste
2. She feeds everything into Claude with a prompt she's refined over a few months
3. Claude generates a one-page brief: key facts, recent patterns, open issues, suggested talking points, potential upsell opportunities

The brief isn't just a summary. It's *synthesized*. It connects dots. "Customer's Q3 orders down 15% while their industry is up 8%—something's wrong. Last support ticket mentioned late deliveries. Previous rep noted they were evaluating FastenalⓇ last year. Possible competitive displacement in progress—prioritize relationship repair over upselling."

She prints it out. One page. Walks into every call prepared.

---

The results:

- Call prep: 45 minutes → 5 minutes
- She's making 3-4 more customer touches per day
- She's catching things she used to miss (the pattern recognition across data sources is huge)
- Q3: 127% of quota. Team average was 94%.

But here's the thing that really got me. She identified a pattern across three of her accounts—similar industry, similar size, all had increasing support tickets about delivery times. She flagged it to ops before any of them complained formally. Turns out there was a routing issue at our Dallas DC affecting that region. We fixed it before it became a customer satisfaction crisis.

That's not in any sales playbook. That's someone synthesizing information in a way that humans usually can't—because the information is too scattered.

---

I want this for my whole team.

Back of envelope: I've got 23 reps in the Southwest region. If they each save 30 minutes per day on call prep, that's 11.5 hours of recovered selling time daily. That's basically getting 1.5 additional reps for free.

But let's be conservative. Say it's only 20 minutes saved, and only 15 reps actually use it well. That's 5 hours per day. Over a year, at average revenue per selling hour, I estimate that's $2-3 million in additional revenue capacity for my region alone.

We've got 8 sales regions. If this scales nationally, we're talking real money.

---

So why isn't everyone doing this?

I asked IT if they could build this properly—connect to the systems, automate the data pull, make it available to all reps.

Their answer:
1. It would need to go through the "enterprise AI governance process"
2. The CRM team is already working on "AI-enhanced account insights" (due date: Q3 next year, so realistically Q1 2027)
3. In the meantime, they "can't support" what Aaliyah is doing because there's no audit trail

So the official solution is 18+ months away. And the unofficial solution that's working right now isn't "supported."

Aaliyah told me she's nervous about sharing this too widely. She doesn't want to get in trouble, and honestly, she sees it as a competitive advantage. If everyone on the team had this, she'd just be average again.

I get her point. But I'd rather have a team of average Aaliyahs than one exceptional one and 22 people still doing it the old way.

---

Jordan, I don't know what you can do with this. But it feels like exactly what you've been talking about. Someone saw a problem, built a solution, proved it works—and now the system is telling her to wait 18 months for permission.

Let me know if you want to meet her. She's in Phoenix but she's in Omaha for the regional meeting next week.

Marcus

**P.S.** — I asked Aaliyah where she learned to do this. She said she's been using AI for personal stuff for over a year and just started wondering "why can't I use this at work?" She didn't take a class. She didn't ask permission. She just started experimenting. I think there are probably more people like her on every team. We just don't know about them because they're keeping quiet.
