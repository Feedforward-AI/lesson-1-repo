### Discussion

Gene presented YTD spend analysis: $1.4M total, with projected full-year spend of $1.8M. Questioned whether we're seeing commensurate value. "We're a year into this journey, and I'm still waiting for someone to show me a number that moves the P&L."

Vikram suggested patience: "We're building capabilities, not just deploying tools."

Sarah noted her team is stretched thin supporting pilots while maintaining security review velocity.

Denise reported third high-performer departure citing "innovation culture" concerns.

Jordan requested dedicated session on Lab proposal before year-end budget decisions. Vikram agreed to schedule.

### Discussion

Significant tension in meeting. Jordan expressed frustration: "We've been 'almost ready' for eight months. Every time we're about to move, there's a new requirement, a new review, a new delay."

Sarah responded: "I'm not the obstacle. I'm the reason we haven't had a breach."

Vikram mediated: suggested we need clearer prioritization framework.

Gene announced he and Vikram would prepare a "state of AI" assessment for Carla and the leadership team by end of December.
