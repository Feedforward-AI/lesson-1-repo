Jordan,

I know you're swamped but I had to tell you about this. Remember when we talked about how I've been using ChatGPT for the checklist stuff? Well one of my new guys did something way better and I think you need to know about it.

His name is Darius Thompson. 22 years old, been here 5 months, works receiving on second shift. No college degree, just smart as hell and pays attention.

Here's what happened. A few weeks ago we had one of those nightmare days where three trucks showed up at the same time and we processed everything in the order it came off the dock, like we always do. Normal procedure. Except it turned out that buried in the second truck was a pallet of safety valves that Consolidated Industries needed for an order shipping that afternoon. We didn't get to it for 6 hours. Order shipped late. Customer was furious. Sales was furious. Everyone blamed everyone.

Darius comes to me after the shift and says "why don't we know which stuff is urgent before we start?"

And I said, well, we'd have to check every incoming item against pending orders and nobody has time for that. It would take hours.

And he says, "what if I could make it take 5 minutes?"

---

So here's what he built. He got access to Claude (paying for it himself, $20 a month out of his own pocket) and figured out how to:

1. Pull the pending orders with same-day and next-day ship dates from the reports Crystal runs every morning
2. Match those against the advance ship notices from our carriers
3. Flag every item on today's incoming trucks that's needed for a hot order
4. Spit out a one-page "priority list" that we print and hand to the receiving team before the first truck arrives

He calls it the Hot Sheet.

It took him maybe a week to figure out, working on it at home after his shifts. He showed me and I almost fell over. It's so obvious once you see it. Why didn't we ever do this?

---

We've been using the Hot Sheet for three weeks now. Here's what's happened:

**Before:** Time from truck arrival to item available for picking averaged 7-8 hours for everything. Urgent stuff waited in line with non-urgent stuff. We'd find out something was needed too late, then scramble.

**After:** Hot items get processed first. Average time-to-available for priority inventory is now under 2 hours. Fill rate on same-day orders is up (I don't have exact numbers but Crystal says it's noticeable). And we've had ZERO late shipments due to receiving delays since we started.

My back-of-envelope math: If we're avoiding even one expedited shipment a week (which we definitely are), that's $500-800 per incident in rush freight. Call it $30K a year just at my facility. But the real savings is in customer satisfaction and not having Sales yelling at us.

Now multiply that across all 12 distribution centers. Some of them are bigger than us. I'd guess this is easily $300-400K in avoided costs company-wide. Maybe more if you factor in the customer retention piece.

For a tool that took a 22-year-old with no technical training a week to build. On his own time. With his own money.

Here's where it gets frustrating.

I mentioned this to Greg in IT because I thought he'd be excited. He was not. He said:

1. We can't have employees using outside AI tools on company data
2. The Hot Sheet isn't connected to the WMS so there's no audit trail
3. If we want to do something like this "properly" it would need to go through the AI Steering Committee
4. In the meantime, we should stop using it pending a security review

Jordan, that review could take months. We both know that. And the Hot Sheet works NOW. We're already getting results. I told Darius we could keep using it quietly but he's nervous about getting in trouble. He's new, he doesn't want to rock the boat.

I also asked Greg if we could at least share the idea with the other distribution centers. He said not until it's been reviewed and approved. So the other 11 facilities are still doing it the old way—processing everything in arrival order, scrambling when hot items get buried, shipping late, pissing off customers.

I also talked to Ramon (the regional ops director) about whether we could get some IT support to connect this to the actual systems properly. He said it would need to go through the capital planning process and there's no budget for "small projects" like this. Minimum threshold for an IT project is $50K and a 6-month timeline.

So a thing that works, that cost $20 a month, that a kid built in a week, that could save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars... is stuck.

I don't know what you can do with this but I wanted you to know it's happening. Darius is exactly the kind of person you talked about in your Lab proposal. He's not a tech person. He's just a guy who saw a problem and figured out how to solve it. And now he's being told to stop.

There are probably more Dariuses out there. People with good ideas who aren't allowed to try them. Or who try them and get shut down. Or who just give up because it's not worth the hassle.

This is what's killing me. It's not that we CAN'T do this stuff. It's that we WON'T.

Let me know if you want to meet Darius. He's a little shy but he'd talk to you. And honestly, someone should tell him he did a good job before he decides this company doesn't care about people like him.

**P.S.** — I asked Darius what else he'd build if he could. He said he's got an idea for predicting which shipments are going to arrive with discrepancies based on which vendors screw up the most. Says we could do receiving prep for problem shipments and cut the "exception cage" time in half. Kid's got more ideas. We're just not letting him use them.
