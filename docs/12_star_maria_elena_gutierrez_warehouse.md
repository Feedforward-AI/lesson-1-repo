# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## Warehouse Inventory Tracking Enhancement

## Background

I've been at Meridian for 18 years. Started loading trucks at 19. Moved up through receiving, inventory, then floor supervisor, now production coordinator. I know this warehouse better than anyone.

Here's what I've watched for two decades: we lose money every single day because the systems we use don't see what I see.

Example: We have "safety stock" formulas in the ERP. They look at historical usage and add buffer. What they don't know is that Bay 17 has a humidity problem every spring that damages cardboard packaging. Or that certain SKUs always get damaged together because they're loaded next to each other on the same truck. Or that the Tuesday night shift has a 3% higher breakage rate than Wednesday night, and it's been that way for years.

I keep all this in my head. When I retire, it walks out with me.

## The Problem I Tried to Solve

Last spring, I asked myself: what if I could get some of this knowledge out of my head and into a system?

I'm not technical. I have a GED. But my nephew showed me ChatGPT over Christmas, and I started thinking about it differently.

I don't need to build a system. I just need to describe the patterns I see and let something smarter figure out how to use them.

## What I Did

I bought a ChatGPT Plus subscription with my own money. ($20/month, which my husband gave me grief about.)

Every night after my shift, I'd spend 20-30 minutes typing up what I noticed. Patterns. Problems. Stuff that doesn't make sense. I'd ask ChatGPT to help me organize it.

After three months I had a document of ~50 pages of operational insights. Things like:

- "When we receive shipments from [Supplier X] on Mondays, check for moisture damage. Their weekend loading crew is careless."
- "SKUs 7734-7742 should never be stored in Zone C during summer. The HVAC doesn't reach that corner properly."
- "If inventory count is off for anything in the electronics category, check the return processing area first. 80% of the time it's a misrouted return, not a loss."

Then I asked ChatGPT to help me turn this into a checklist format that other supervisors could use.

## Results

I shared the checklist with the other shift supervisors. Informally, not through any official channel.

Over the past four months:
- Inventory shrinkage in our facility is down 12% vs. same period last year
- Damage claims from Zone C are down 40% (we moved the sensitive SKUs)
- Time spent investigating inventory discrepancies is down maybe 30% (we check the likely spots first now)

I can't prove all of this is because of the checklist. But the supervisors who are using it say it helps.

## What I Learned

The AI didn't know anything about our warehouse. But it was really good at helping me organize what I know. It asked me questions I hadn't thought to ask. It helped me see patterns in my own experience.

I think there's something important here: the people who know the most about Meridian's operations are often people like me, who aren't technical and don't have degrees. But we have decades of knowledge that isn't captured anywhere.

If Meridian gave people like me access to AI tools and permission to experiment, I think we'd find a lot of value that the system people would never find because they don't know what to look for.

## Why I'm Sharing This

Jordan Torres heard about what I was doing and asked me to write it up. She said there might be something called an "AI Lab" where people could experiment more officially.

I'd be interested in that. Not full-time—I have a job I'm good at—but maybe part-time helping figure out how AI could help operations.

I know I'm not the typical person for something like this. I don't have a college degree. I've never worked in an office. But I know things that matter, and I think the AI could help me share that knowledge in ways that help the company.

*"Maria Elena's initiative represents exactly the kind of bottom-up innovation we should be encouraging. Her checklist has become an informal standard across our shift supervisors. I fully support her participation in any expanded AI experimentation."*
