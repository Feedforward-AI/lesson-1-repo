> ⚠️ **Note from CS Leadership (added October 2025):** This playbook is overdue for an update. Several steps reference tools we no longer use. Please use your judgment and ask teammates if something seems outdated. Update planned for Q1 2026 "when we have bandwidth."

## Overview

This document outlines the standard 90-day onboarding process for new enterprise customers. Each new customer requires approximately **25-35 hours** of CSM time across the onboarding period, plus ongoing account management.

---

## Pre-Kickoff Preparation (4-6 hours)

### Step 1: Customer Research (90-120 minutes)
- [ ] Review signed contract and SOW
- [ ] Pull company info from LinkedIn, website, press releases
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders and their roles
- [ ] Search for any prior relationship (previous vendor, events attended)
- [ ] Review any sales notes from CRM (often incomplete)
- [ ] Google news for recent company developments
- [ ] Check if any employees are LinkedIn connections

*Note: This step takes longer than it should because information is scattered. Sales notes are in Salesforce, contract details in DocuSign, email threads in Outlook, and meeting notes sometimes in Notion, sometimes in Google Docs.*

### Step 2: Success Plan Creation (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Open success plan template (SharePoint > CS Templates > Onboarding)
- [ ] Customize goals section based on what sales learned
- [ ] Map customer's stated objectives to our product capabilities
- [ ] Identify 3-5 key metrics to track
- [ ] Build 90-day milestone timeline
- [ ] Create stakeholder map
- [ ] Draft kickoff agenda

*Note: "Customization" in practice means copying a previous customer's plan and changing names/details. The template itself hasn't been updated since 2022.*

### Step 3: Technical Readiness (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] Verify provisioning is complete
- [ ] Confirm integrations are configured per SOW
- [ ] Set up sandbox environment if applicable
- [ ] Create customer-specific documentation links
- [ ] Test login credentials for primary contacts

*Note: Provisioning errors occur ~30% of the time. Build in buffer for troubleshooting.*

## Week 1: Kickoff

### Step 4: Kickoff Meeting Prep (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] Create kickoff deck from template
- [ ] Customize slides with customer logo and context
- [ ] Prepare demo environment with customer-relevant examples
- [ ] Send calendar invite with agenda and prep materials
- [ ] Brief any internal participants

### Step 5: Kickoff Meeting (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] Introductions and role alignment
- [ ] Review success plan and gather feedback
- [ ] Confirm stakeholders and communication preferences
- [ ] Walk through product basics
- [ ] Schedule follow-up sessions
- [ ] Document action items

### Step 6: Kickoff Follow-up (30-45 minutes)
- [ ] Send meeting notes within 24 hours
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks in CRM
- [ ] Share relevant resources
- [ ] Update success plan based on meeting discussion

---

## Weeks 2-4: Foundation

### Step 7: Training Sessions (4-6 hours total)
- [ ] Admin training (90 min)
- [ ] End user training session 1 (60 min)
- [ ] End user training session 2 (60 min)
- [ ] Q&A / office hours (60 min)

*Note: Training content is generic. Each CSM typically creates their own "customer-specific" examples by manually adapting the standard training deck. This takes 1-2 hours per customer.*

### Step 8: Weekly Check-in Prep (30 min/week)
For each weekly check-in:
- [ ] Review usage data from analytics dashboard
- [ ] Check support ticket queue for this customer
- [ ] Scan Slack/email for any communications
- [ ] Review progress against success plan milestones
- [ ] Prepare talking points and questions
- [ ] Update CRM notes from last meeting

### Step 9: Weekly Check-in Meeting (30-45 min/week)
- [ ] Progress review
- [ ] Issue resolution
- [ ] Roadblock identification
- [ ] Next steps alignment

### Step 10: Check-in Documentation (15-20 min/week)
- [ ] Send meeting notes
- [ ] Update CRM opportunity record
- [ ] Update success plan
- [ ] Log any expansion signals
- [ ] Flag any risk indicators

---

## Weeks 5-8: Expansion

### Step 11: Usage Analysis (60-90 minutes, bi-weekly)
- [ ] Pull usage reports from analytics tool
- [ ] Export data to spreadsheet for trending
- [ ] Compare to success plan benchmarks
- [ ] Identify underutilized features
- [ ] Flag adoption concerns
- [ ] Prepare recommendations

*Note: Our analytics tool doesn't have a "customer health" dashboard. CSMs manually compile data from 3-4 different reports.*

### Step 12: Stakeholder Expansion (varies)
- [ ] Identify additional users/departments
- [ ] Schedule introduction calls
- [ ] Provide tailored demos
- [ ] Support internal champion communications

### Step 13: Integration Optimization (2-4 hours if applicable)
- [ ] Review integration performance
- [ ] Troubleshoot any issues with technical team
- [ ] Document custom configurations
- [ ] Train on advanced integration features

---

## Weeks 9-12: Solidify

### Step 14: Business Review Preparation (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Compile usage metrics and trends
- [ ] Calculate ROI using customer-provided data (if available)
- [ ] Document wins and success stories
- [ ] Identify expansion opportunities
- [ ] Create QBR deck

*Note: QBR deck creation is highly manual. We pull data from 5+ sources, create charts in PowerPoint, and write narrative summaries. This takes a full afternoon for each customer.*

### Step 15: 90-Day Business Review (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] Present progress against goals
- [ ] Review metrics and ROI
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Discuss expansion/renewal
- [ ] Plan for ongoing engagement

### Step 16: Transition to Ongoing Management
- [ ] Update success plan for post-onboarding phase
- [ ] Establish recurring meeting cadence
- [ ] Document institutional knowledge
- [ ] Introduce any new team members who will be involved
- [ ] Close out onboarding project in CRM

## Time Investment Summary

|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Pre-Kickoff | 4-6 hours | Research, planning, prep |
| Week 1 | 3-4 hours | Kickoff + follow-up |
| Weeks 2-4 | 8-12 hours | Training, weekly touches |
| Weeks 5-8 | 6-8 hours | Analysis, expansion |
| Weeks 9-12 | 5-7 hours | QBR prep, transition |

- Renewal activities
- Support escalations
- Internal meetings
- Administrative tasks

## Known Pain Points (Added by CSM team)

*The following issues have been flagged repeatedly but not yet addressed:*

1. **Research duplication:** Every CSM researches the same customer from scratch. No shared knowledge base of customer intel.

2. **Template staleness:** Training materials, success plan templates, and QBR decks haven't been updated in 12+ months.

3. **Data fragmentation:** Customer information lives in Salesforce, Notion, SharePoint, email, Slack, and personal notes. No single source of truth.

4. **Manual metrics:** Usage analysis requires exporting and manipulating data manually. No automated health scoring.

5. **Repeated questions:** New CSMs ask the same questions repeatedly. No FAQ or "how we do things" documentation.

6. **Handoff gaps:** When CSMs leave or accounts transfer, institutional knowledge is lost. No systematic handoff process.

7. **Personalization time:** "Customizing" templates is 80% find-and-replace. Could be automated.

8. **Meeting prep:** 30+ minutes of prep for every 30-minute call. Most of this is hunting for information.

*Last time someone raised these: July 2024 team meeting. Status: "Good ideas, no bandwidth."*

*Questions about this playbook? Ask your team lead. This document hasn't been updated because we've had three team leads in 18 months and updating documentation keeps falling off the priority list.*
