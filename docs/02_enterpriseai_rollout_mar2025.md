# ANNOUNCEMENT

**From:** Vikram Anand, CTO  
**To:** Meridian Industries - All Employees  
**Date:** March 3, 2025  
**Subject:** Introducing EnterpriseAI.ai - Your New AI Assistant

---

I'm excited to announce that starting today, all Meridian employees will have access to EnterpriseAI.ai, our new enterprise AI platform.

EnterpriseAI.ai brings the power of generative AI directly into the tools you already use. Whether you're drafting emails in Outlook, building presentations in PowerPoint, analyzing data in Excel, or collaborating in Teams, AI assistance is now just a click away.

## What You Can Do

- **Write faster**: Draft emails, reports, and documents with AI assistance
- **Summarize smarter**: Get instant summaries of long documents and meeting transcripts
- **Analyze deeper**: Ask questions about your spreadsheets in plain English
- **Present better**: Generate presentation outlines and speaker notes automatically

## Getting Started

EnterpriseAI.ai is already active in your Microsoft 365 apps. Look for the AI icon in the toolbar. We've also scheduled training sessions throughout March—check MeridianLearn for times.

## A Few Guidelines

Working with Sarah Ndiaye and her security team, we've established clear guidelines for responsible use:

- **Do** use EnterpriseAI.ai for internal documents and routine communications
- **Don't** input confidential customer data, trade secrets, or sensitive HR information
- **Do** review all AI outputs before sending—you're still responsible for accuracy
- **Don't** use external AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)—EnterpriseAI.ai is our approved platform

## This Is Just the Beginning

As Carla said in January, we're at an inflection point. EnterpriseAI.ai is our first major step toward becoming an AI-enabled organization. Your feedback will shape where we go next.

Try it today. Experiment. And let us know what you discover.
