**PROPOSAL**

**Meridian AI Lab: Building the Future Today**

**Submitted by:** Jordan Torres, Head of AI Initiative

**Date:** September 28, 2025

**Version:** 2.1

Executive Summary

I\'m proposing we create a dedicated AI Lab: a small team of high
performers with access to frontier AI tools and a mandate to experiment,
learn, and spread knowledge across Meridian.

This isn\'t about replacing our current approach. It\'s about creating a
parallel track where we can move faster, learn more, and develop the
organizational muscle we\'ll need as AI capabilities accelerate.

|                                   |                                   |
| \$400K incremental annual cost    | 8 high performers + 2 developers  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**Timeline:** 12-month initial commitment with quarterly reviews

The Problem We\'re Solving

**We\'re stuck.**

Our current approach---enterprise-wide deployment of a \"safe\" tool
(EnterpriseAI.ai) with extensive governance---has produced:

• 37% adoption

• Minimal workflow transformation

• Growing frustration from our most capable people

• Zero competitive advantage

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing faster than our evaluation
process. By the time we approve a tool, it\'s already a generation
behind.

I\'ve talked to dozens of employees across Meridian. The consistent
theme: *\"I want to use AI, but the tools we\'re given aren\'t good
enough, and the tools I want to use aren\'t allowed.\"*

We\'ve created a system optimized for risk avoidance that\'s actually
generating a different kind of risk: the risk of falling behind.

The Proposal

What

A dedicated team of 10 people, working with frontier AI tools, tasked
with:

**1. Discovering** high-value AI applications across Meridian\'s
functions

**2. Developing** prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations

**3. Documenting** what works, what doesn\'t, and why

**4. Disseminating** knowledge across the organization

**5. De-risking** future enterprise deployments by learning in a
contained environment

Who

**8 \"Star Performers\"** selected from across the organization:

  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Production/Operations   Marketing               Supply Chain

  Finance                 Legal Operations        Customer Insights

  R&D/Innovation          HR/Talent               Sales Operations
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

**Selection criteria:**

• Demonstrated high performance in current role

• Curiosity and willingness to experiment

• Ability to communicate learnings to non-technical colleagues

• Diverse perspectives (we want different mental models, not eight of
the same person)

**2 AI-Capable Developers:** Technical support for the star performers.
Build custom integrations and tools. Bridge between experimentation and
production deployment.

Investment

  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------
  **Category**                                  **Annual Cost**

  Star performer backfill (partial)             \$180K

  2 FTE developers                              \$280K

  Tool access (API costs, licenses)             \$120K

  Infrastructure                                \$40K

  Training and development                      \$30K

  **Total incremental**                         **\$650K**

  **Less: existing budget reallocation**        **(\$250K)**

  **Net new investment**                        **\$400K**
  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------

*Note: This assumes we reduce EnterpriseAI.ai licenses from 2,000 to 500
(covering employees who actually use it), saving \$540K annually. If we
net that against the Lab investment, we\'re actually reducing total AI
spend while increasing capability.*

The Ask

I\'m asking for:

1\. Approval to form the Lab with the investment outlined above

2\. Authority to select participants with input from their managers

3\. Governance model as described (Security and Legal visibility, not
veto)

4\. 12-month commitment with quarterly reviews

5\. Executive sponsor (I\'d suggest Carla directly, given the
cross-functional nature)

**I believe this is the highest-leverage investment Meridian can make in
2026.** I\'m happy to answer questions and refine the proposal based on
feedback.
