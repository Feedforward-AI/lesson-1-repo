# Clarification: Get the AI Lab Approved
Generated: January 10, 2026

---

## The Quick Version

You need Carla to approve your $400K AI Lab proposal. If she says yes, Gene and Vikram will fall in line. The 90-day pause they're proposing is death - not a delay, but the end of the initiative and probably your role here.

This is an inflection point for everyone. For Meridian: approve the Lab and build the capability to compete, or reject it and begin a slow decline into irrelevance as talent leaves and competitors pull ahead. For Carla: this is her AI bet, and if it fails, it's her legacy failure. For Vikram: whoever controls AI controls his relevance - he's a blocker now, but could become an ally if you make him feel like a winner. For Gene: he's scared of what he doesn't understand, will follow Carla's lead. For you: this is career-defining - win and you become a leader in AI deployment, lose and you leave with nothing to show for a year's work.

Carla needs two things: a vision that rekindles her excitement, and proof it can work (the star performers). Your unlock with Vikram is making him feel like this is his success - executive sponsor, visible credit, maybe a "glory machinery" workstream he owns. You've been too polite, too willing to step back. This time you need to push.

### Goal

Get Carla to approve the $400K AI Lab proposal. Budget approval is the win - once you have resources, you can prove value.

### Success Criteria

- Carla gives full endorsement
- Gene and Vikram sign off (they will if Carla leads)
- $400K budget approved
- Lab launches rather than 90-day pause

### Stakes

**If this succeeds:**

For the company:
- Competitive advantage - Meridian builds real AI capability
- Talent retention - best people stay and are empowered
- Capability building - organizational muscle for what's coming

For you personally:
- You get to do work you believe in (this matters most to you)
- Career advancement - promotion, visibility
- External reputation as someone who gets AI right
- Options - leverage whether you stay or go

**If this fails:**

For the company:
- Downward spiral into irrelevance
- Best people leave or are hobbled with inadequate tools
- Wake up one day as a has-been - can't compete, can't control costs, no new products
- Legacy business hemorrhaging talent and customers

For you personally:
- Career stalls - "the AI person who couldn't deliver"
- You leave, but with nothing to show for a year's work
- Credibility damaged, further behind than when you started

### Key People

#### Carla Benedetti (CEO) - THE TARGET
- **Role**: Ultimate decision maker. If she's in, others follow.
- **What drives her**: Big swings, feeling inspired, learning new things, legacy
- **What she fears**: Looking foolish, losing Gene/Vikram's confidence, making the wrong call either way
- **Current stance**: Open but cautious - the Gene/Vikram memo gave her pause
- **What would move her**: Compelling vision that rekindles excitement + proof it can work (star performers, concrete examples)
- **Classification**: Decision maker, persuadable

#### Gene Hollister (CFO) - BLOCKER, WILL FOLLOW
- **Role**: Co-authored the skeptical memo, controls budget sign-off
- **What drives him**: Fear. He doesn't understand AI, doesn't know how to measure it, easier to dismiss it. Likes being the expert - AI makes him feel like he's not.
- **What he fears**: Being out of his depth, looking foolish approving something he doesn't understand
- **Current stance**: Blocker
- **What would move him**: Carla's endorsement. He'll fall in line.
- **Classification**: Blocker who follows the leader

#### Vikram Anand (CTO) - GATEKEEPER, POTENTIAL ALLY
- **Role**: Your boss. Co-authored memo pushing for more IT control.
- **What drives him**: Turf, power, not becoming irrelevant. AI is his inflection point too - if he controls it, he expands power; if it goes around him, he's diminished.
- **What he fears**: Being bypassed, losing control of AI
- **Current stance**: Blocker on paper, but persuadable
- **What would move him**: Credit, visibility, a piece he can own. Make this feel like his success - executive sponsor role, "Vikram glory machinery" workstream.
- **Classification**: Gatekeeper who could become ally
- **Key tension**: He wants control, but might mess it up if he had it. Need to give him enough to feel like a winner without giving him the keys.

#### The Star Performers - LATENT ALLIES
- **Role**: Maria Elena, Wendy, Carl, Amit, Annette, Trevor, Reggie, Becky, Tony - plus unknown others doing things unofficially
- **What they represent**: Bubbling enthusiasm ready to be harnessed or crushed. Proof that capable people with capable tools produce results.
- **How to use them**: Evidence for Carla. The Lab isn't theory - these people are already delivering.

### Constraints

- Can't fully bypass security/legal - but a sandbox approach could work
- Can't make Vikram or Gene look bad - they need to save face
- Going over Vikram's head is possible but weakens the proposal
- Budget ask is $400K - probably can't go higher

### Context & History

- You became Head of AI a year ago
- Original vision (Carla's Davos memo): transformational change
- What actually happened: incremental, slow change that produced nothing
- EnterpriseAI.ai rolled out to 25,000 people, 37% adoption, but usage is shallow
- Pilots stalled in security/legal review cycles
- $8M spent with no measurable business impact
- Gene/Vikram just issued memo calling for 90-day pause

**Your honest self-assessment:**
- You failed to find the right balance of vision, pushiness, political savvy, and politeness
- You stepped back too often, didn't push hard enough
- You didn't highlight the decision points that moved things to a slow pace
- You're not sure what you could have done differently
- This time needs to be different

### Urgency

The 90-day pause is not a pause - it's death. If you don't win now:
- The initiative dies, rebranded as "strategic reset"
- Star performers give up or leave
- Competitors extend their lead
- Your credibility expires
- There is no next round

**This is it.**
