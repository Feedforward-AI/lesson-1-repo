## Week of December 9-13, 2025
## Prepared by: Jordan Torres

---

### Executive Summary

*Note: This report was completed in 90 minutes instead of the usual half-day due to board prep taking priority. Some sections are incomplete.*

**Overall Status:** 🟡 Yellow (was Green last week)

**Key Highlight:** EnterpriseAI.ai adoption holding steady at 37% MAU

**Key Concern:** Supply chain pilot delayed again; stakeholder frustration growing

---

### Adoption Metrics

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly Active Users | 243 | 247 | 500 |
| Weekly Sessions | 1,847 | 1,923 | 3,000 |
| Avg Session Length | 5.8 min | 6.1 min | 10 min |

**Analysis:** *[Didn't have time for deep analysis. Numbers are directionally flat. Would normally segment by department and feature but that takes 2+ hours to compile.]*

---

### Pilot Program Updates

**Customer Insights Pilot (Active)**
- Status: On track
- Metric: 20% faster analysis cycle
- Note: *[Should verify this number with the team but haven't had time to schedule the check-in]*

**Marketing Internal Comms Pilot (Active)**
- Status: Struggling
- Metric: Adoption declining
- Note: *[Need to do root cause analysis. Team says tool isn't meeting needs but haven't documented specifics]*

**Supply Chain Pilot (Delayed)**
- Status: Blocked
- Blocker: Security review, now in week 6
- Note: *[Was supposed to get update from Sarah's team - haven't heard back. Following up.]*

**R&D Innovation Pilot (Proposed)**

### Issues & Risks

**Issue 1: No systematic way to track AI tool usage patterns**
- Impact: Can't identify which features are valuable vs. underused
- Need: Someone to build usage analytics dashboard
- Workaround: Manual exports from vendor portal (takes ~4 hours/week)

**Issue 2: Pilot success criteria undefined**
- Impact: Can't objectively measure if pilots are working
- Need: Retrospective definition of success metrics
- Workaround: *[None - we're essentially guessing]*

**Issue 3: Feedback collection is fragmented**
- Impact: User complaints scattered across Slack, email, support tickets
- Need: Centralized feedback repository
- Workaround: I try to scan channels weekly but definitely miss things

---

### Stakeholder Feedback (Anecdotal)

*[Would normally include quotes from user interviews but didn't have time to conduct any this week. Here's what I've heard in passing:]*

- Finance: "The meeting summary feature keeps getting names wrong"
- Sales: "It's faster to just write the email myself"
- Engineering: "The code suggestions are usually wrong for our stack"
- Legal: "We're not allowed to use it for anything confidential, which is everything"

*[These are second-hand impressions, not validated user research.]*

### Requests / Decisions Needed

1. **Steering Committee Scheduling:** December meeting was cancelled. January meeting not yet scheduled. Who is responsible for this?

2. **Supply Chain Pilot Escalation:** Should I escalate the security review delay to Vikram?

3. **Budget Clarity:** Q1 budget still not confirmed. Hard to plan with uncertainty.

4. **Lab Proposal:** Gene/Vikram memo suggests Lab proposal "not ready." What specific feedback should I address?

### Time Allocation This Week

*[Tracking this because I've been asked how I spend my time]*

| Activity | Hours | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Board prep / leadership requests | 18 | *Unplanned; displaced everything else* |
| Stakeholder meetings | 8 | *Mostly status updates, low value* |
| Email / Slack | 6 | *Could not estimate this without tracking tool* |
| Actual initiative work | 5 | *Troubleshooting, user support* |
| This report | 1.5 | *Usually takes 4+ hours* |
| Admin / logistics | 3 | *Calendar, expenses, etc.* |

**Observation:** I spent less than 15% of my time this week on work that advances the AI initiative. Most time went to reporting *about* the initiative or responding to ad-hoc requests. This is not sustainable.

---

### What I Would Do With More Time

*[Including this because it's been requested]*

1. **User research:** Interview 20 heavy users and 20 non-users to understand the adoption gap
2. **Competitive analysis:** What are other companies doing with enterprise AI tools?
3. **Success story documentation:** I know there are people getting value but we haven't captured their workflows
4. **Integration assessment:** Map all the systems EnterpriseAI.ai *could* connect to vs. *does* connect to
5. **Training redesign:** Current training is generic; should be role-specific
6. **Policy simplification:** Our AI usage policy is 23 pages; nobody reads it

*[Each of these would take 20-40 hours. I don't have 20-40 hours.]*

---

### Next Week Focus

1. Resume usage audit (if no new fires)
2. Complete remaining 3 department interviews
3. Follow up on supply chain pilot security review
4. Begin Lab proposal revision

*[Confidence that I'll complete all of these: Low]*
