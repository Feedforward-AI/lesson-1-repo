I just returned from Davos, and I need to share something with all of you.

For twenty years, I've attended conferences where people talked about "transformation" and "disruption." Most of it was hype. You learn to filter. But this year was different. I sat in rooms with CEOs I respect—people running serious companies, not tech evangelists—and watched them describe changes I wouldn't have believed eighteen months ago.

One conversation stays with me. A peer who runs a company twice our size told me: "Carla, I don't know exactly what this means yet. But I know that in three years, the companies that figured it out will be unrecognizable, and the ones that didn't will be in trouble." She wasn't selling anything. She was worried.

I've been thinking about Meridian's history. We've been through transformations before—the move to ERP in the 90s, the supply chain digitization in the 2010s. Each time, we succeeded because we moved decisively while others hesitated. We didn't wait for perfect clarity. We built the capacity to adapt.

I believe we're at another such moment. Artificial intelligence—and I mean the generative AI that's emerged in the last two years, not the analytics we've used for decades—represents a fundamental shift in how work gets done. Not incremental improvement. A genuine discontinuity.

I don't have a detailed roadmap to share today. Anyone who claims certainty about how this unfolds is either selling something or hasn't thought hard enough. What I do have is conviction that we need to move, and move now.

In the coming weeks, Vikram and his team will be rolling out new capabilities across the organization. We'll be forming a steering committee to coordinate our approach. We'll be investing in training and tools.

But I want to be clear about something: this isn't an IT initiative. This is about how every function, every team, every individual at Meridian thinks about their work. The companies that treat AI as a technology project will lose to the companies that treat it as an organizational transformation.

I'm asking each of you to approach this with curiosity and courage. Try things. Break things. Tell us what you learn. The only failure mode I'm worried about is standing still.

More to come.

Carla
