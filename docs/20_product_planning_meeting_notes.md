### Discussion Summary

#### Q4 Feature Performance

**Alex Rivera:** Let's start with how Q4 features are performing. Nina, do you have the adoption data?

**Nina Patel:** Partial data. I have login metrics from the product analytics tool, but the engagement metrics are in a different system that I don't have access to. Sam was supposed to pull those but he's out today.

**Jordan Lee:** Can we proceed without engagement data?

**Nina Patel:** We can talk about *what* people are clicking on but not *whether it's helping them*. Two different questions.

**Alex Rivera:** Let's work with what we have. What about customer feedback?

**Nina Patel:** I have NPS verbatims but haven't analyzed them. There's about 400 responses from Q4. Reading and categorizing them would take me two full days.

**Jordan Lee:** Can you give us the highlights?

**Nina Patel:** I can give you the top-line score (42, down from 47) and a few quotes I happened to notice. But I can't tell you themes or trends without doing the actual analysis.

#### Customer Research Gaps

**Sam Taylor** (via proxy - notes from Jordan Lee): 

Competitive feature analysis status:
- Dashboard module: No systematic comparison done
- Reporting features: Outdated analysis from Q2
- API capabilities: Never analyzed
- Mobile experience: Quick screenshots, no deep dive

**Alex Rivera:** So we're prioritizing features without knowing what competitors offer?

**Jordan Lee:** That's been the case for a while. We rely on what sales hears in deals, which is selective.

**Alex Rivera:** What would it take to do proper competitive analysis?

**Jordan Lee:** Sam estimated 4-6 hours per competitor, and we track 5 main competitors. So 20-30 hours minimum. Plus it goes stale quickly—probably need to refresh quarterly.

**Derek Huang:** That's essentially a part-time job.

**Alex Rivera:** Which nobody has been assigned.

*[Action: Discuss competitive intelligence resourcing with leadership - Owner: Alex]*

#### Q1 Roadmap Discussion

**Derek Huang:** Before we prioritize, can someone summarize what customers have been asking for?

**Nina Patel:** I have a feature request log but it hasn't been updated since September. About 200 requests total, not deduplicated or categorized.

**Derek Huang:** So we don't know if 50 customers asked for the same thing or 50 different things?

**Nina Patel:** Correct. Each request is logged as a separate row. Cleaning and deduping that data is on my list but keeps getting pushed.

**Jordan Lee:** We also have feature requests buried in support tickets that nobody's extracted.

**Customer Success Rep (Kenji Nakamura, invited):** And in our QBR notes. Probably 30-40 feature mentions from enterprise customers that never made it to the product backlog.

**Alex Rivera:** So our "voice of customer" data is scattered across at least four systems—NPS surveys, feature request form, support tickets, and CS notes—and nobody's synthesizing it?

**Multiple:** [Nodding]

*[Action: Inventory all customer feedback sources and assess consolidation - Owner: Nina - ETA: December]*

#### Resource Allocation Discussion

**Alex Rivera:** Based on what we discussed, we have some foundational work to do before we can make good prioritization decisions:

1. Q4 feature engagement analysis
2. NPS thematic analysis  
3. Competitive feature comparison
4. Customer feedback consolidation
5. Feature request deduplication

**Derek Huang:** That's easily 100+ hours of work.

**Alex Rivera:** And it's work that enables us to make good decisions vs. making decisions anyway with incomplete information.

**Jordan Lee:** We've been choosing "make decisions with incomplete information" for as long as I've been here.

**Nina Patel:** Because the research work is invisible. Nobody gets credit for "cleaned up the feature request database." You get credit for shipping features.

**Alex Rivera:** Fair point. But we keep having these conversations where we say "we should really know X before deciding" and then decide anyway.

*[Action: Alex to raise research capacity issue with leadership]*

#### Quick Wins Identified

Despite research gaps, team identified some likely priorities based on available signals:

1. **Performance improvements** - Multiple support escalations, clear pain
2. **Export functionality** - Sales reports this comes up in every enterprise deal
3. **SSO integration** - Blocking several large prospects (per CS)
4. **Mobile notifications** - Requested by exec sponsor of largest customer

*[Note: These are prioritized by "loudest signal" not "biggest opportunity" - systematic analysis might yield different priorities]*

### Parking Lot (Topics for Future Discussion)

- How do we capture tribal knowledge from long-tenured employees?
- Sales enablement content is outdated—who owns this?
- Customer onboarding materials need refresh—last updated 2023
- Documentation is scattered across 4 tools—consolidation needed?

### Meta-observation

This meeting spent approximately 45 minutes discussing what we *don't know* before we could discuss what we *should do*. Several participants noted this is a recurring pattern.

Suggested process improvement: Create a "research readiness checklist" before planning meetings to surface data gaps *before* the meeting rather than during.

*[Volunteer to own this: None identified]*
