# STAR PERFORMER PROJECT SUMMARIES

## Wendy Schafer
**Role:** Senior Marketing Manager, Brand Strategy  
**Years at Meridian:** 8  
**Project:** Competitive Voice Analysis System

### What She Built

Wendy got frustrated that our competitive intel was always weeks out of date. By the time analyst reports came out, competitors had already moved.

Using personal Claude access (yes, against policy), she built a weekly process:
1. Collect competitor press releases, social posts, job listings, and earnings call transcripts
2. Feed them to Claude with a consistent prompt asking for tone, messaging shifts, and strategic signals
3. Produce a 2-page "competitive voice memo" for the brand team

### Results
- Caught a competitor's pivot to sustainability messaging 6 weeks before it became their campaign theme
- Identified an acquisition target before it was announced (based on job posting patterns)
- Brand team now treats her memo as essential reading

### Her Take
"EnterpriseAI.ai can't do this. I tried. It can't handle the volume, and it doesn't have the analytical depth. I feel like I'm doing something valuable but also like I could get in trouble for it. That's a weird position to be in."

### Manager Note
"Wendy's competitive intelligence work has become indispensable to our quarterly planning. If there's a way to do this officially, we should." — Derek Yoo, VP Brand

## Carl Henriksen
**Role:** Supply Chain Analyst, Logistics Optimization  
**Years at Meridian:** 12  
**Project:** Carrier Performance Prediction Model

### What He Built

Carl noticed that our carrier selection was entirely backward-looking: we'd score carriers on last quarter's performance. But carrier quality fluctuates—they lose drivers, they change routes, they get acquired.

He built a monitoring system:
1. Scrapes carrier reviews from industry forums, Glassdoor (for their employees), and news
2. Cross-references with our own delivery data
3. Flags carriers showing early warning signs before the problems hit our shipments

### Results
- Predicted two carrier service degradations 4-6 weeks before they showed up in our metrics
- Avoided an estimated $180K in shipping delays by preemptively shifting volume
- Now consulting with procurement on contract renewals

### His Take
"I'm using tools nobody approved, but nobody's asked me to stop either. I think leadership knows and looks the other way because the results are there. That's not a sustainable situation."

### Technical Note
Carl built this using Claude API access he pays for personally, plus some Python scripts he wrote. He is self-taught. "YouTube and Claude taught me more than any training we've been offered."

## Amit Chadha  
**Role:** Senior Financial Analyst, FP&A  
**Years at Meridian:** 5  
**Project:** Variance Explanation Generator

### What He Built

Every month, FP&A produces variance analyses: what happened vs. what we budgeted. The analyses are critical but tedious—lots of manual digging through data to explain each line item.

Amit built a system that:
1. Takes the raw variance data from our ERP
2. Pulls in contextual data (sales notes, operations reports, known issues)
3. Generates first-draft variance explanations
4. Flags items that need human investigation

### Results
- Reduced monthly variance analysis time from 5 days to 2 days
- Caught a misclassification error that had been recurring for 3 quarters
- Finance leadership now expects AI-assisted first drafts

### His Take
"I showed this to Gene [Hollister] and his reaction was... complicated. He was impressed by the output but concerned about the method. He said 'this is exactly what we should be doing, but not like this.' I don't know what that means for me."

### Risk Note
Amit's system processes financial data that may include confidential information. He claims he's careful about what he inputs, but there's no audit trail. This is exactly the kind of use case that should be sanctioned and governed, not improvised.
