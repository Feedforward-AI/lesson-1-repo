# Battle Plan: Get the AI Lab Approved
Generated: January 10, 2026

## Situation Summary

You need Carla to approve the $400K AI Lab before the 90-day pause becomes permanent death. Carla is open but cautious after the Gene/Vikram memo. Gene is a blocker driven by fear - he'll follow Carla. Vikram is a gatekeeper who feels bypassed - he could become an ally if you make him feel like a winner.

You have powerful ammunition you haven't fully deployed: nine star performers who produced real results by working around the official system. And you have Carla's own words from a year ago - "The only failure mode I'm worried about is standing still."

Your pattern has been too polite, too willing to step back. This time you push.

## The Plan

> **Note:** This document serves as your action checklist. Leave it in project docs to help the LLM track progress and assist with execution.

### Phase 1: Prepare

**Research to Gather:**

- [ ] **Carla's current calendar and mood** - When is she most receptive? What's competing for her attention? Who has her ear right now?
- [ ] **What Gene has said privately** - Any back-channel intel on whether he's truly opposed or just posturing?
- [ ] **Vikram's real concerns** - What specifically makes him feel bypassed? What would make him feel respected?
- [ ] **Star performer readiness** - Which of the nine would be compelling in front of Carla? Who presents well under pressure?

**Documents to Create:**

- [ ] **Response memo to Gene/Vikram**
  - Audience: Carla primarily, cc Gene and Vikram
  - Must accomplish: Reframe the pause as the risky choice, not the safe one
  - Key points:
    - Acknowledge $8M spent, modest results - but diagnose WHY correctly
    - The problem isn't too much AI, it's too little capability with too much friction
    - Show the star performer results as proof the approach works
    - Position the Lab as the low-risk path: contained experiment with capable people
    - Use Carla's own words: "The only failure mode I'm worried about is standing still"
  - Tone: Confident, direct, not defensive

- [ ] **One-page star performer summary**
  - Audience: Carla
  - Must accomplish: Visceral proof that this works
  - Key points:
    - Nine people, nine functions, nine real results
    - None from EnterpriseAI.ai - all from working around the system
    - All technically policy violations
    - "We're suppressing success"
  - Format: Visual, scannable, with numbers that pop

- [ ] **Vikram partnership proposal** (private)
  - Audience: Vikram only
  - Must accomplish: Make him feel like a winner, not a bystander
  - Key points:
    - Executive sponsor role with visible credit
    - Specific workstream he owns (governance framework? IT integration?)
    - His team gets resources (the 2 AI-capable developers report to IT?)
    - He presents wins to the steering committee
  - Tone: Collaborative, respectful of his concerns

### Phase 2: Build Support

**People to Win Over:**

#### Vikram Anand (CTO) - Convert blocker to ally FIRST
- [ ] **Approach**: Private 1:1 before anything goes to Carla
- [ ] **Key message**: "I want this to be your win. Help me figure out how."
- [ ] **Appeal to**: His fear of irrelevance, his desire for control and credit
- [ ] **Offer specifically**:
  - Executive sponsor title
  - Governance workstream he owns and presents
  - Developers reporting through IT
  - First look at all materials before they go wider
- [ ] **Best timing**: Before you send any response to the Gene/Vikram memo
- [ ] **Success looks like**: He privately signals support, or at least neutrality. He doesn't co-sign Gene's opposition.

#### Carla Benedetti (CEO) - THE TARGET
- [ ] **Approach**: Request a focused 30-minute meeting, not a group discussion
- [ ] **Key message**: "A year ago you said the only failure mode is standing still. We're standing still. The Lab gets us moving again."
- [ ] **Appeal to**:
  - Her love of big swings and vision
  - Her fear of legacy failure
  - Her own words from January 2025
- [ ] **Bring**:
  - The star performer summary (proof)
  - A reframe of risk (pause is the risky choice)
  - Vikram's support (if you've secured it)
- [ ] **Best timing**: After Vikram conversation, before any formal leadership discussion
- [ ] **Success looks like**: She says "I want to make this happen" and asks what she needs to do

#### Gene Hollister (CFO) - Neutralize, don't convert
- [ ] **Approach**: Don't try to convince him directly - he'll follow Carla
- [ ] **Key message** (indirect): "This is a contained $400K experiment, not another $8M bet"
- [ ] **Give him an off-ramp**:
  - Quarterly reviews with clear kill criteria
  - License consolidation savings that offset the cost
  - Frame it as "disciplined experimentation" not "more spending"
- [ ] **Success looks like**: He doesn't actively block. He defers to Carla.

### Phase 3: Execute

**Sequence of Moves:**

1. [ ] **First: Private conversation with Vikram**
   - Why first: If he's on board, everything else gets easier. If he's actively opposing, you need to know now.
   - Sets up: Either partnership or clarity that you're going around him
   - Key ask: "What would make you feel like this is your win?"

2. [ ] **Then: Prepare the response memo**
   - Depends on: Vikram conversation - tone may shift based on his stance
   - Sets up: Carla meeting, formal response to Gene/Vikram memo
   - Don't send yet - use it as prep for Carla meeting

3. [ ] **Then: Request 30 min with Carla**
   - Frame: "I want to share a perspective on the AI path forward before the leadership discussion"
   - Bring: Star performer one-pager, your reframe, Vikram's position (if supportive)
   - Ask: "I need you to champion this. Will you?"

4. [ ] **Then: Send formal response memo**
   - Depends on: Carla's reaction
   - If she's supportive: memo becomes confirmation of direction she's already endorsed
   - If she's hesitant: memo becomes the argument you make publicly

5. [ ] **Then: Leadership discussion**
   - You're not presenting cold - you've pre-wired Vikram and Carla
   - Gene follows Carla's lead
   - Goal: Formal approval, not just discussion

### Objections & Responses

| Likely Objection | From Whom | Underlying Concern | Response |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| "We spent $8M with nothing to show" | Gene | Wasted capital | "The $8M bought shallow adoption of a limited tool. The Lab is $400K for deep capability with capable people. Different bet entirely." |
| "We need a 90-day pause to assess" | Gene/Vikram | Fear of more waste | "A pause means the star performers give up or leave. A pause means competitors extend their lead. The pause is the risky choice, not the safe one." |
| "The Lab proposal doesn't have clear success metrics" | Gene/Vikram | Lack of accountability | "Fair. Let's define quarterly milestones with explicit kill criteria. I'm not asking for blind faith - I'm asking for a disciplined experiment." |
| "We're not a tech company" | Gene/Vikram | Fear of overreach | "Agreed. We're not trying to build AI - we're trying to use it. The star performers aren't engineers. They're operations, sales, finance people using AI to do their actual jobs better." |
| "This goes around IT governance" | Vikram | Turf protection | "I want IT to own the governance workstream. Vikram as executive sponsor. His team provides the technical foundation. This is IT-led, not IT-bypassed." |
| "We should wait for stable, proven tools" | Vikram | Risk aversion | "Nine people already proved it works. They just did it outside the system. The Lab legitimizes what's already happening." |

### Checkpoints

How you'll know you're on track:

- [ ] Vikram privately indicates support (or at least non-opposition)
- [ ] Carla agrees to a focused meeting
- [ ] Carla expresses enthusiasm or "I want to make this happen" language
- [ ] Gene doesn't actively rally opposition
- [ ] Formal approval in leadership discussion

### Risks & Contingencies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Vikram actively opposes even after partnership offer | Medium | High | Be prepared to go around him with Carla's support. Have a version of the pitch that doesn't require his buy-in. |
| Carla sides with Gene/Vikram on pause | Low-Medium | Very High | You probably leave. But before that, make the strongest case - use the star performers, use her own words, name the stakes clearly. |
| Star performers aren't willing to be visible | Low | Medium | Tony and Maria Elena seem most confident. You only need 2-3 compelling examples, not all nine. |
| Gene escalates to the board | Very Low | High | Unlikely at $400K level. But if he does, you have Carla's cover. |
| You revert to "polite Jordan" mode | Medium | High | Catch yourself. Write down: "This time is different. Push." Review before each conversation. |

## Next Actions

The immediate next steps (do these first):

1. [ ] **Schedule the Vikram 1:1** - This week. Private setting. Frame as "I want your input before I respond to the memo."

2. [ ] **Identify your 2-3 strongest star performers** - Who would present well to Carla? Who has the most compelling numbers? Reach out to gauge their willingness to be visible.

3. [ ] **Draft the Vikram partnership proposal** - What specifically can you offer him? Executive sponsor, governance workstream, developer reporting lines. Make it concrete.

4. [ ] **Pull Carla's Davos memo quotes** - "The only failure mode I'm worried about is standing still." Have her own words ready to use.

5. [ ] **Block time to write the response memo** - Don't rush it. This is your argument. Make it sharp.
