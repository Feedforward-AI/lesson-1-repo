### Analysis: Where Answers Already Exist

**Self-service available but not used:** 847 inquiries (30%)
- PTO balance, time-off requests, direct deposit, address changes
- Answers are literally 2-3 clicks in HRIS
- **Why not used?** "I didn't know I could do that myself" / "Couldn't find it"

**Documented in handbook but not found:** 689 inquiries (24%)
- PTO policy, holidays, WFH policy, dress code
- **Why not found?** 127-page PDF, no search, not mobile-friendly

**Requires HR action but could be templated:** 512 inquiries (18%)
- Employment letters, benefits explanations, policy clarifications
- Same response given repeatedly with minor customization

**Genuinely requires HR judgment:** 394 inquiries (14%)
- Leave of absence decisions, accommodation requests, sensitive matters
- Appropriate for HR professional involvement

**Unclear/scattered documentation:** 405 inquiries (14%)
- Referrals, training, performance process
- Information exists but location is not obvious

---

### Repeat Questioners

**People who asked 5+ questions in 6 months:** 124 employees
**Total questions from this group:** 891 (31% of all inquiries)

**Pattern analysis:**
- 67% were employees in first 6 months of tenure (onboarding gap)
- 22% were managers asking on behalf of their teams
- 11% were employees who "prefer to just ask HR"

**Observation:** A better onboarding experience and manager self-service toolkit would eliminate ~400 questions/year.

### Time Analysis: Where HR Time Goes

| Category | Questions | Avg Time | Total Hours | Reducible? |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Findable self-service | 847 | 5 min | 71 hrs | 95% |
| Documented in handbook | 689 | 7 min | 80 hrs | 85% |
| Template-able responses | 512 | 12 min | 102 hrs | 70% |
| Requires HR judgment | 394 | 22 min | 144 hrs | 20% |
| Scattered documentation | 405 | 15 min | 101 hrs | 60% |

**Total potentially reducible time: ~380 hours over 6 months**
**Annualized: ~760 hours/year ≈ 0.4 FTE**

### Verbatim Examples

**Same question, different people (all within one week):**

> "Hi! Quick question - what's our PTO policy? I looked in the handbook but couldn't find it. Thanks!"

> "Hey HR team, I need to know how many PTO days I get. Can someone point me in the right direction?"

> "Does anyone know the PTO accrual rate? I searched the intranet but no luck."

> "Sorry to bother you - PTO question. Is it use-it-or-lose-it?"

> "Can you tell me how PTO works here? I'm planning a vacation."

**Five people, same week, same topic.** Total HR time: ~35 minutes. The answer is on page 34-37 of the handbook, but clearly nobody's finding it.

---

**Employment verification requests (monthly pattern):**

Every month we receive 15-25 requests for "verification of employment" letters:
- Mortgage applications
- Apartment rentals  
- Background checks
- Immigration sponsorships

Each one requires:
1. Receive request
2. Look up employee in HRIS
3. Open letter template
4. Fill in dates, title, salary (if authorized)
5. Get signature
6. Email back

**Time per letter:** 20-30 minutes
**Monthly time:** 6-10 hours
**Potential solution:** Self-service verification system (many exist)

### Top 10 Questions That Should Have Self-Service Answers

| Question | Current Process | Better Process |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| PTO balance | Employee emails HR; HR looks up | Dashboard/app shows real-time |
| Submit time off | Employee emails; HR enters | Employee submits in system |
| Holiday calendar | PDF attachment in handbook | Synced to Outlook calendar |
| Benefits summary | HR emails PDF | Online portal with comparison tool |
| Expense report how-to | Written guide (outdated) | Video walkthrough + chatbot |
| Employment verification | Manual letter process | Automated verification service |
| Pay stub access | HR provides link | Single sign-on integration |
| Direct deposit change | Form + HR processing | Self-service in HRIS |
| Address update | Form + HR processing | Self-service in HRIS |
| Training catalog | Buried in LMS | Searchable directory |

### HR Team Commentary

**From Becky Stoltzfus:**
> "I became an HR professional to help people with meaningful career and workplace challenges. Instead, I spend 30% of my time answering questions like 'how do I submit a time-off request.' We need better tools or I'm going to lose my mind."

**From Tom Richardson:**
> "The frustrating thing is we *have* documentation. We have an HRIS. We have self-service. But nobody can find anything, so they email us. We're essentially human search engines for our own systems."

**From Maria Santos:**
> "New employees are the worst-served. They have 100 questions in their first week and no good way to get answers except asking us. An onboarding chatbot would save everyone time."

### Recommendations

**Quick wins (minimal investment):**
1. Pin FAQ document in company Slack with links to top 10 topics
2. Add "How do I...?" section to HRIS homepage
3. Create short video for expense report submission
4. Mobile-friendly version of key handbook sections

**Medium investment:**
1. Contract with employment verification service
2. HR chatbot for policy questions (could use existing AI tools)
3. Onboarding buddy program to reduce HR questions
4. Manager self-service toolkit

**Strategic investment:**
1. Knowledge base with search across all HR documentation
2. AI-powered "ask HR" interface that answers common questions automatically
3. Integrated employee experience platform
4. Automated letter/document generation

### What We've Tried

| Initiative | Result | Why It Didn't Work |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| "Read the handbook first" campaign | No change | Nobody reads 127-page PDFs |
| FAQ document on SharePoint | Minimal use | Hard to find, out of date |
| HRIS training sessions | Modest help | People forget or don't attend |
| Manager office hours | Low attendance | Inconvenient timing |
| Monthly newsletter with tips | Briefly helped | Gets archived unread |

**Conclusion:** Push strategies don't work. We need pull - make it easier to find answers than to ask HR.
