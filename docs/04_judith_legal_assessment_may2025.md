# PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
## Attorney-Client Communication

**From:** Judith Abramowitz, Chief Legal Officer  
**To:** AI Steering Committee  
**Date:** May 8, 2025  
**Subject:** Legal Risk Assessment - Expanded AI Capabilities

---

At the Steering Committee's request, I've reviewed the legal implications of the proposed AI expansion initiatives. This memo summarizes key risk areas requiring attention.

## 1. Intellectual Property Rights

### Generated Content Ownership
The legal landscape for AI-generated content remains unsettled. Key questions:

- **Copyright**: The Copyright Office has indicated AI-generated content may not be copyrightable. If we rely on AI for marketing copy, product documentation, or creative assets, we may have limited IP protection.
- **Work Product**: When employees use AI to draft contracts, analyses, or recommendations, who owns what? Our standard IP assignment language may not adequately address AI-assisted creation.
- **Derivative Works**: If AI outputs are based on training data that included copyrighted material, are our outputs derivative works? The case law is evolving rapidly.

### Trade Secret Exposure
Any confidential information entered into AI systems may lose trade secret protection if we can't demonstrate reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. The current logging and access controls may be insufficient.

## 2. Contractual Liability

### Binding Commitments
I'm concerned about AI-generated content that could be construed as binding. If a sales rep uses AI to draft a proposal, and that proposal contains terms we didn't intend to offer, are we bound? We need guardrails around:

- Pricing commitments
- Delivery timelines
- Warranty language
- Liability caps

### Vendor Agreements
The proposed AI vendors' terms of service contain concerning provisions:
- Broad usage rights to inputs and outputs
- Limited liability caps
- Unilateral modification rights
- Arbitration clauses that may disadvantage us

I recommend renegotiating before expanding deployment.

## 3. Employment Law

### Discrimination Risk
If we use AI for any HR-related functions (resume screening, performance analysis, promotion recommendations), we inherit the model's biases. Recent EEOC guidance makes clear that employers are liable for discriminatory AI outcomes, regardless of intent.

### Reasonable Accommodation
What are our obligations if employees cannot effectively use AI tools due to disability? This needs HR input.

## 4. Regulatory Compliance

### SEC Implications
For our publicly traded securities, any AI-generated content in investor communications, financial reports, or earnings materials requires careful review. Management attestation requirements don't have an AI exception.

### Industry-Specific
Our pharma clients have FDA documentation requirements. Our financial services clients have FINRA/SEC obligations. AI-generated content in these contexts carries heightened risk.

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Pause** expansion until vendor agreements are renegotiated
2. **Develop** clear policies on AI use in binding communications
3. **Create** review protocols for high-risk content categories
4. **Train** employees on legal boundaries
5. **Monitor** regulatory developments—this space is changing monthly

I'm not opposed to AI adoption. I'm asking that we do it with appropriate legal infrastructure in place. Moving fast is fine; moving recklessly is not.

I'm available to discuss at the May 15 Steering Committee meeting.
