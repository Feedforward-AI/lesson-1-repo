Carla,

I wanted to flag something I'm seeing in the field that concerns me.

In the past four months, we've lost three top performers from customer-facing roles. All three cited some version of "I want to work somewhere that's serious about AI" in their exit interviews.

The specifics:

**Marcus Chen** (Senior Solutions Architect, 6 years)
- Went to a Series C startup
- Exit interview: "Meridian talks about AI but I can't actually use it. I spent six months waiting for approval to pilot a tool that would have cut my proposal time in half. At [new company], I had access day one."

**Priya Sharma** (Strategic Account Director, 4 years)  
- Went to a competitor
- Exit interview: "I was losing deals because their team could turn around custom analyses overnight. I was still doing it manually. When I asked for better tools, I got a security review that went nowhere."

**David Okonkwo** (Product Manager, 3 years)
- Went to a tech company
- Exit interview: "I love Meridian, but the pace is glacial. Every idea needs twelve approvals. I wanted to experiment with AI-assisted product research and got told to 'wait for the enterprise rollout.' That was eight months ago."

These aren't people who were looking to leave. They were frustrated high performers who got recruited because they're exactly who AI-forward companies want.

I'm hearing similar rumblings from others. The phrase I keep hearing is "innovation theater"—we announce AI initiatives but nothing actually changes in their day-to-day work.

The competitive dynamic is real. In three recent deal reviews, I've seen competitors demonstrate AI-powered capabilities we can't match. We're not losing on price or product. We're losing on the perception that we're a step behind.

I don't know what the right answer is, but I wanted you to have this data point. The slow pace isn't just frustrating our internal champions—it's becoming a talent and competitive liability.

Happy to discuss.

Denise
