# Power Analysis

Analyze power dynamics and develop realistic strategies.

## Usage

```
/power-analysis
```

## Where This Fits

```
/clarify → /power-analysis → /executive-persuasion → /battle-plan
```

Use after `/clarify` when navigating complex politics. Optionally follow with `/executive-persuasion` for influence tactics, then `/battle-plan` for full sequencing.

## What This Does

Maps the political landscape using Pfeffer's realist principles:

- **Self-interest drives behavior** - What do people actually want?
- **Past behavior predicts** - What have they done before?
- **Formal ≠ informal power** - Who really decides?
- **Trust is frequently violated** - Who might betray?

## How It Works

1. Reviews any Clarify output and case documents
2. Assesses each key player (power, self-interest, track record, stance)
3. Maps formal vs. informal power structures
4. Identifies coalitions and opposition
5. Generates political strategy with action checkboxes

## Output

Saves a power analysis to `docs/` with:
- Player-by-player assessment table
- Structural power map
- Coalition landscape
- Self-protection measures
- Sequenced strategic actions
