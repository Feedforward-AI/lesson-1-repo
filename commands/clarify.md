# Clarify

A structured discovery interview that helps you understand both what you're proposing and how to make it happen.

## Usage

```
/clarify
```

## What This Does

Launches an adaptive questioning session that covers two dimensions:

**The Substance:**
- What are you actually proposing?
- What evidence do you have?
- What are the gaps and weaknesses?
- What research would strengthen your case?

**The Politics:**
- Who decides and who influences?
- What drives each key person? What do they fear?
- What are the stakes - for the company and for you?
- What constraints are you working within?

## How It Works

- Starts with "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- Uses multiple choice for speed
- Goes deep on stakes, key people, AND strength of your case
- You can skip or move on anytime
- Shows which areas are covered vs. remaining

## Output

Saves a clarification document to `docs/` that includes:
- A clear, direct summary at the top
- Full details organized by Substance and Politics
- Offers to create a Battle Plan when done
