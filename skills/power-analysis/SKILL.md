name: power-analysis
description: Analyze organizational power dynamics and develop realistic political strategies. Uses a Pfeffer-inspired realist lens - assumes self-interest drives behavior, past actions predict future actions, and formal authority often differs from real power. Use after /clarify when navigating complex stakeholder situations, building coalitions, or when you need to understand who really has power and what they'll actually do. Complements /executive-persuasion (which provides influence tactics) by mapping the political landscape first.

# Organizational Power Analysis

Analyze power dynamics and develop realistic strategies using a Pfeffer-inspired lens that prioritizes evidence over wishful thinking.

## Where This Fits

```
/clarify → /power-analysis → /executive-persuasion → /battle-plan
              ↓                      ↓                     ↓
          Map who has            Tactics for           Sequence all
          power, what            key targets           actions
          they want
```

**Power Analysis** maps the landscape: who has real power, what they actually want, who will support or betray you.

**Executive Persuasion** (optional next step) adds influence tactics for specific targets.

**Battle Plan** sequences everything into executable actions.

## Quick Reference: The Seven Pfeffer Principles

### 1. Self-Interest Drives Behavior
Assume people act in their own interest—career advancement, job security, status, money, reduced workload. When stated motivation doesn't align with self-interest, be suspicious. You'll predict behavior more accurately.

### 2. Past Behavior Predicts Future Behavior
What someone has *done* matters more than what they *say* or what you *hope*. Research how they've behaved in similar situations. Did they keep commitments? Share credit? Throw people under the bus under pressure?

### 3. Modesty Is Penalized, Self-Promotion Works
No one gets selected for what they can't remember. Good work doesn't speak for itself—visibility is a prerequisite to credit. Watch for who self-promotes effectively; they're more dangerous than their competence suggests.

### 4. Trust Is Frequently Violated
Trust-breakers often face minimal consequences. Others calculate "what can they do for me?" not "what did they do to someone else?" When someone has betrayed others, assume they'll betray you given sufficient incentive.

### 5. Even "Good" Cultures Turn
Layoffs happen at "best places to work." Leaders who "care about people" make cuts when economics demand. Don't over-invest in organizational loyalty—it won't be reciprocated proportionally.

### 6. Power-Getting Differs From Leadership Prescriptions
Traits that acquire power (confidence, self-promotion, political skill) differ from what leadership books prescribe (humility, authenticity). Don't underestimate the politically skilled but substantively mediocre.

### 7. Power Changes People
The powerful hear "yes" more often and believe their own hype. They have different (rosier) information than you. Their risk tolerance is higher. Appeals to empathy may be less effective than appeals to self-interest.

## Before Starting

1. **Check for Clarify output** - Look in `docs/` for `clarify-*.md` files
2. **If found**, extract: goal, key people, stakes, context
3. **If not found**, ask: "Want to run /clarify first, or should I gather context now?"
4. **Gather case materials** - Offer to review documents (emails, org charts, meeting notes)

## Phase 1: Document Review

### Opening
> "I'll analyze your situation through a power-dynamics lens. Do you have any documents I should review? This could include org charts, emails, meeting notes, or background on key players. Or we can work from what you tell me directly."

### What to Extract from Documents

**On Key Players:** Names, roles, stated vs. actual behaviors, track record on promises, relationships and alliances, what they control, signs of real motivations

**On Structure:** Formal hierarchy vs. informal power, who actually gets things done, resource allocation, recent power shifts

**On Culture:** Gap between espoused values and actual behaviors, how conflicts have been resolved, who gets rewarded for what

**On Situation:** History of this issue, previous attempts and why they failed, current pressures, timing factors

## Phase 2: Objective Clarification

Use Clarify output where available. Fill gaps through conversation.

```

```

## Next Steps

Feed this analysis into:
- `/executive-persuasion` - for specific influence tactics with key targets
- `/battle-plan` - for full action sequencing with research and documents
```

## Key Reminders

**Don't be naive about:**
- People keeping their word
- Gratitude translating to future support
- Fairness determining outcomes
- Good work speaking for itself
- Loyalty being reciprocated

**Do be realistic about:**
- Self-interest as the primary driver
- Visibility being essential to credit
- Written records protecting you
- Past behavior predicting future behavior
- The difference between allies and friends

**The goal is not cynicism** but accurate assessment. Sometimes people are trustworthy. Sometimes cultures are healthy. The skill is distinguishing when that's true vs. when you're believing what you want to believe.

## After Completion

Ask: "Want to add influence tactics for specific targets with /executive-persuasion, or go straight to /battle-plan to sequence all your actions?"
